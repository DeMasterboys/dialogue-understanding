Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.

Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Great, how much would you like to donate today?

Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	What are your other plans for the day today?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.

Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	What kind of camera do you have?	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?

I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.

How much money a year does save the children raise?	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?

I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	What do you do for work and do you like it?

You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?

Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.

Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.

Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Do you know where I can go to donate?	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	All of us should be in this world together.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.

I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Thank you :)	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.

20180903-103939_512_live	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I guess I could throw them .10	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	It wouldn't hurt to give more.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	You know they're worse off than you, right?	Honestly < do not think so.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	This is the only one that comes to mind	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	tell to family and friends is a first step	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.

WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	That way i know where my money is going.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?

I little bit of know Save the children life.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	No thank you for the work that you do	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!

I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	No thank you for the work that you do	tell to family and friends is a first step	Thank you so much for telling me about this.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	This is the only one that comes to mind	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	i can walk but that is all can do.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	It was great chatting with you.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.

20180723-100855_385_live	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	You could find that out here at this website.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	i can walk but that is all can do.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I hope more people think like you and me	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	That is very thoughtful of you.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Of course!	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day
20180723-100855_385_live	Hi...	how are you today?	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	42% of their funding is from US.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Of course!	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day

It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.

The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.

It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	How much do we have to share with them?	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?

20180723-100855_385_live	Hi...	how are you today?	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Have you heard of it?	im doing well!	How about you?

It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	How much do we have to share with them?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	i can walk but that is all can do.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	If only more people were more giving like you!	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.

No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.

What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.
20180827-033451_673_live	Hi there, how are you this morning?	ya fine morning what about you	Good thanks.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Have you heard of them?	Yes I know that organization.	you have idea donate to that charity	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	ok nice.	how much u pay	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	No thank you for the work that you do	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	I don't work cause I already retired.	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	What are your other plans for the day today?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I dealt with that more when I was working.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I usually just try to go with half for these things.

Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	No but I can tell you about the charity!	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.

HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.

20180825-043516_619_live	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	How much do we have to share with them?	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	How much do we have to share with them?	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	It will help these children in a big way.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.

St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.
20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Great, how much would you like to donate today?

Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I would like to start making a difference today.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	And share on social media could be the next step?	I would love to help in anyway I can.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I know we can both feel good about that.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I dealt with that more when I was working.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	And share on social media could be the next step?	tell to family and friends is a first step	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them

I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?

You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.

I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.

Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.

I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.

I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	I hope more people think like you and me	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Goodbye.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	Have a wonderful day.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	And a few other local charities specifically for children.
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Not bad.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	And share on social media could be the next step?	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	And share on social media could be the next step?	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I am kind of curious about the details though.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	This is the only one that comes to mind	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.

We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I know right, It is a big thing to do.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.

You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.

I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.

We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.

Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

20180723-052203_936_live	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Great, how much would you like to donate today?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	That way i know where my money is going.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?

20180723-052203_936_live	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).

Great, how much would you like to donate today?	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Thank you!

Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.

I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.

I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.

So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Great, how much would you like to donate today?	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Children should be a priority in the world.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	they sound like a good charity to donate to	And share on social media could be the next step?	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.

I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!

That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?

There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.

This is the only one that comes to mind	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	The money would at least go to a good cause.

I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I am glad you were there to help him.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.

Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	No but I can tell you about the charity!	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	And share on social media could be the next step?	they sound like a good charity to donate to

I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.

If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.

That way i know where my money is going.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	they are good too, but this one I prefer	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	they are good too, but this one I prefer	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Thank you!	If only more people were more giving like you!	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.

For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I am not sure I am just very biased	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	That makes my heart so happy.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.

Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	they are good too, but this one I prefer	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	they are good too, but this one I prefer	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	And share on social media could be the next step?	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I would love to help in anyway I can.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.

Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.

Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.

I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	I dealt with that more when I was working.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.

They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	every other month or so, but not to them	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.

I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.

My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	If only more people were more giving like you!	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.

No thank you for the work that you do	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.

Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Have you heard of them?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.

Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	every other month or so, but not to them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	I am not sure I am just very biased	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	?

But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

What are your other plans for the day today?	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.

20180825-053711_81_live	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	I little bit of know Save the children life.	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?

Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	every other month or so, but not to them	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	I dealt with that more when I was working.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.

When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	every other month or so, but not to them	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!

How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.

I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	every other month or so, but not to them	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.

Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	And share on social media could be the next step?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	every other month or so, but not to them	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	are there any charities that you favor?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.

Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	And share on social media could be the next step?	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	I little bit of know Save the children life.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?

Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.

Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Thank you for your time, have a great day.

I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.

What was life like for you as a kid?	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.

I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Yea.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.

Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c
20180719-175233_833_live	Hey there	Hey how's it going?	So children's charity then...	Yep.	Do you happen to be a parent?	No, not currently.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.

So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?

I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c

It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.

Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.

We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.

Yes I have.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.

I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."

Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I would love to help in anyway I can.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I love helping where I can.	Those less fortunate deserve better.	These children die from hunger daily.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Do you donate to this cause as well?	If so, how much do you give?	I do  !	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I think you are a wonderful person.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.

Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	You've been great.
20180826-021724_326_live	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	All of us should be in this world together.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Do you donate to this cause as well?	If so, how much do you give?	I do  !

20180826-021724_326_live	Are you aware of what save te children does?	I am not sure I am just very biased	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I do  !	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I think you are a wonderful person.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.

20180826-021724_326_live	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.

20180826-021724_326_live	Are you aware of what save te children does?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.

I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!
