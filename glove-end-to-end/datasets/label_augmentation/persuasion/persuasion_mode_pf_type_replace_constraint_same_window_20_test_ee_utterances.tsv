Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?

Yes, a few times before	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.

Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.

If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	That way i know where my money is going.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?

If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.

I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.

20180826-180300_663_live	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	Hello	Would you like some information about the charity first?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Great, how much would you like to donate today?	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

20180826-180300_663_live	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Nope, what do you recommend?	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	And share on social media could be the next step?	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!

Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.

I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I would like to start making a difference today.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Do you know where I can go to donate?

Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!

Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?

I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?

I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.

20180826-180300_663_live	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	That would work best for me.

Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

20180826-180300_663_live	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	You can't see him - ha ha.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?

I have not heard of Save the Children before.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	i can walk but that is all can do.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.

I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	yes .	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	God bless and good morning.

OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.

I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Do you currently volunteer with this charity?	I do.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Will you consider a donation?	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Is this organization Christian or religious based?	It is in terms of values.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	What is your recommendation on how we can help	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Great, how much would you like to donate today?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?

20180825-081859_875_live	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	How much do we have to share with them?	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.
20180825-081859_875_live	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Thank you so much for telling me about this.

They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?

They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	That is a great cause.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	And share on social media could be the next step?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	How much do we have to share with them?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.

What is your recommendation on how we can help	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.

However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	every other month or so, but not to them	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.

The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	The money would at least go to a good cause.	No thank you for the work that you do	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	For sure.

It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	What is your recommendation on how we can help	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?

I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	i can walk but that is all can do.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	And share on social media could be the next step?	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	What more can we do for the least of these?	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?

20180826-020520_686_live	Hello!	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Would you take it?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Would you do it now?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	i get that.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	That's very good since they do so much for children.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.

20180825-055427_625_live	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	they sound like a good charity to donate to	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	I do the same for World Vision.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.

Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	I sponsor 3 children.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	I am glad you were there to help him.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	I know we can both feel good about that.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.

Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	That way i know where my money is going.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	How much would you be willing to donate today?	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	That way i know where my money is going.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I dealt with that more when I was working.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.

I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	That way i know where my money is going.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Sure.	I would love to help.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?

What are you hoping your donation will help with?	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	It will help these children in a big way.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.

You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

There are ways to make a difference for sure.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Would you like to help and donate to them?	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?

I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	What are your other plans for the day today?	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding.

I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.

I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!

You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?

I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	The money would at least go to a good cause.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?

It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	No thank you for the work that you do	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Have you donated to Save the Children before?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.
20180825-102556_172_live	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	How much do we have to share with them?	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	Well, don't feel bad.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	every other month or so, but not to them	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?
20180825-102556_172_live	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Do they help our children in the US as well?	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	And share on social media could be the next step?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	We will donate today.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I hope more people think like you and me	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	every other month or so, but not to them	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	No thank you for the work that you do	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.
20180825-102556_172_live	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Can you tell me more about what they do?

I dealt with that more when I was working.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I propose we stick with our half plan.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I think it has to do with helping sick children.

We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.

Is there anything else I need to do?	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.

So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	I am kind of curious about the details though.

The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	That way i know where my money is going.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

If only more people were more giving like you!	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Can you tell me more about what they do?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I think i will make a donation of $2	If only more people were more giving like you!	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.

I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

20180723-052203_936_live	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!

My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You would like to donate a dollar a day?

Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.

Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	I would like to start making a difference today.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	No thank you for the work that you do	I am glad you were there to help him.

For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas

Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I little bit of know Save the children life.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	It hurts my heart.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!

Absolutely.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.

It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Well that sounds just great to me!	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I little bit of know Save the children life.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.

I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I see no reason not to help this charity.

That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I will spread the word!
20180723-122005_335_live	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I used to donate to them.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	are you still there?	yes! i said that's a fair point.	save the children is a good choice.
20180723-122005_335_live	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Do you like that charity?	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	yes! i said that's a fair point.	save the children is a good choice.
20180723-122005_335_live	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	What do they do exactly?	you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.
20180723-122005_335_live	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	That is super important work, obviously.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I am glad you were there to help him.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.

Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.

I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.
20180826-175345_318_live	Hi!	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Yeah, what do you think about St Jude's?	I recommend Save the Children children's charity.	That's wonderful!	Do you have any specific country in mind?	No but I can tell you about the charity!	Sure!	I'd love to hear more.	Go on...	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Have you ever sponsored a child?	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	every other month or so, but not to them	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	How much would you be willing to donate today?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	How much are you donating?	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too

Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	It will help these children in a big way.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.

Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.

Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	What are your other plans for the day today?	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..

I know we can both feel good about that.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.
20180825-053711_81_live	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	i suppose	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Are you aware of what save te children does?	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	That's very good since they do so much for children.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	i would not doubt that all.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I am not sure I am just very biased	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	Are you aware of what save te children does?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I am kind of curious about the details though.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	So no	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	they are good too, but this one I prefer	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	You could find that out here at this website.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	i said I do this for a living.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	And share on social media could be the next step?	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	I am not sure I am just very biased	No thank you for the work that you do	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Would you like to help and donate to them?
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	do you know what save the children fund does?	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	You have plenty of rich people out there	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	every other month or so, but not to them	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	i cant do that either.	And share on social media could be the next step?	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.

They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I dealt with that more when I was working.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	I dealt with that more when I was working.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	every other month or so, but not to them	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	I know we can both feel good about that.

OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	i can walk but that is all can do.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?

Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.

Its because I dont trust non profits	That's understandable.	Thank you for your time today.	No thank you for the work that you do	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I am not sure I am just very biased

On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Would you like some information about the charity first?	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	Yea what do you got?	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	If only more people were more giving like you!	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	How much do we have to share with them?	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	You could find that out here at this website.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.

20180723-070336_48_live	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	This is the only one that comes to mind	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I think that is is awful and sad.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.

Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	What do we do about it?	do you know what save the children fund does?	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.

I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.
20180723-070336_48_live	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?

That's very good since they do so much for children.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.

A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Yes, I would like to hear more.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.

I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I love helping where I can.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	maybe there are children who may die without this money	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?

I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?

No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.
20180826-021724_326_live	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I am kind of curious about the details though.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.

Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?

It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I am glad you were there to help him.

They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.

Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.
