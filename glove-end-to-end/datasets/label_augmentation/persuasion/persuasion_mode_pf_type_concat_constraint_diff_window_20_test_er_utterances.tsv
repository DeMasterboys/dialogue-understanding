20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today?	Hey I'm fine. Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	How are you doing? I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I am doing really good. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	So, what are you up to today? For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I can't decide which onne. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children. Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	How do you feel about this charity? How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Do you know that charity's mission? Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing. A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I really like their mission. The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	I really feel badly for the kids. It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Don't you? That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	They are based in CT. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Could you donate anything to them?	yes I can.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	no this is my first time.	what do I do now?	You do not have to do anything else.	I am really glad that you donated.	What are your other plans for the day today?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	What kind of camera do you have?	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?
20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today? They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Hey I'm fine. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	How are you doing? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	I am doing really good.	So, what are you up to today? I understand but these children have even less than us.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I can't decide which onne. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children. Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	How do you feel about this charity? Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission. How much money a year does save the children raise?	Do you know that charity's mission? I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	I really like their mission. Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	I really feel badly for the kids. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Don't you? As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	They are based in CT. It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	Could you donate anything to them? Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	yes I can. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	no this is my first time.	what do I do now?	You do not have to do anything else.	I am really glad that you donated.	What are your other plans for the day today?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	What kind of camera do you have?	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?
20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today? they are good too, but this one I prefer	Hey I'm fine. No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	How are you doing? I would like to start making a difference today.	I am doing really good. It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	So, what are you up to today?	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I can't decide which onne. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children. they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	How do you feel about this charity? Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Do you know that charity's mission? Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.

Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	They are based in CT. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Could you donate anything to them? Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	yes I can. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I can donate 10 dollars. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.

It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I can't decide which onne. That way i know where my money is going.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children. Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	How do you feel about this charity? Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Do you know that charity's mission? I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing. you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	I really like their mission. They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	I really feel badly for the kids. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Don't you? I know we can both feel good about that.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	They are based in CT. Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Could you donate anything to them?

I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Gotta feed the hungry first It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Yes! The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I think that is a great idea. Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause. This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?

I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?

I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Could you donate anything to them? Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	yes I can. they sound like a good charity to donate to	I can donate 10 dollars. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Wow! They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	that is so great. Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Thank you so much. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes? You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	OH, yeah food please. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?

Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	What kind of camera do you have?

I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.

Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Do you have anything like that?

Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	What kind of camera do you have? Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I have a really old digital camera. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.

Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.

People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Do you have anything like that? Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?

Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Do you have anything like that? But I do agree with the points you made in support.
20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today?	Hey I'm fine.	How are you doing?	I am doing really good.	So, what are you up to today?	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I can't decide which onne.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	How do you feel about this charity?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Do you know that charity's mission?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I really like their mission.	I really feel badly for the kids.	Don't you?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered?	They are based in CT.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Could you donate anything to them?	yes I can.	I can donate 10 dollars. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Wow! they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	that is so great. If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	Thank you so much. Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes? Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	OH, yeah food please. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Gotta feed the hungry first I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Yes! Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	I think that is a great idea. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this? I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	no this is my first time. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	what do I do now? I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	You do not have to do anything else. I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	I am really glad that you donated. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	What are your other plans for the day today? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic. Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. You could find that out here at this website.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	What kind of camera do you have? I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I have a really old digital camera. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good. Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Do you have anything like that? Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself

Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much. All of us should be in this world together.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes? In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	OH, yeah food please. That way i know where my money is going.	Gotta feed the hungry first What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Yes! Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	I think that is a great idea. the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause. Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	Have you ever donated to a charity before this? The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	no this is my first time. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	what do I do now? have you ever done any donation to this charity?	You do not have to do anything else. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	I am really glad that you donated. As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	What are your other plans for the day today? You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing. Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic. It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	What kind of camera do you have? I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. How much do we have to share with them?	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Do you have anything like that? It's not much, but I don't have much money.

Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	OH, yeah food please. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Gotta feed the hungry first Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Yes! It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	I think that is a great idea. Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause. You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this? They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	no this is my first time. I would like to start making a difference today.	what do I do now? Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	You do not have to do anything else. I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I am really glad that you donated. Have you ever donate for children in your area?	What are your other plans for the day today? A productive activity to fill your free time with.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing. SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	What kind of camera do you have? I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	I have a really old digital camera. I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good. What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? I am kind of curious about the details though.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Do you have anything like that? I think it is important to do all we can to help children.

How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Gotta feed the hungry first The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Yes! They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	I think that is a great idea. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause. i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this? Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	no this is my first time. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	what do I do now? Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	You do not have to do anything else. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	I am really glad that you donated. Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	What are your other plans for the day today? I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic. Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	What kind of camera do you have? But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I have a really old digital camera. You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Do you have anything like that? Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?

Gotta feed the hungry first Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Yes! I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I think that is a great idea. A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Have you ever donated to a charity before this? I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	no this is my first time. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	what do I do now?

Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	What kind of camera do you have? I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	I have a really old digital camera. What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.

Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Do you have anything like that? I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.

I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I know right, It is a big thing to do. This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	some people donate whole their life and time. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate? i hope you will also donate to make a wish.

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	I am not a member, but i donate.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.

I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Save the Children is a great organization. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.

If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	They do. That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	But they also assist in other ways. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Sounds like they really help education wise. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	They do. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	But they also assist in other ways. Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Oh so they do more than just help with education. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Thats awesome! I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I couldn't agree more. They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. There is a lot of info about the organization there.	It sure does. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	ANything else I should know about this charity? well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	It is a huge movement. Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	It sure does. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	ANything else I should know about this charity? I would like to start making a difference today.	It is a huge movement. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Can you tell me more about what they do?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	These kids really deserve it :) That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Literally every penny helps these children. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. i can walk but that is all can do.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello! It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before? So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Yes, I absolutely have. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Save the Children is a great organization. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Sounds like they really help education wise. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	They do. I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	But they also assist in other ways. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Thats awesome! i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	I couldn't agree more. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	ANything else I should know about this charity? I little bit of know Save the children life.	It is a huge movement. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. How much do we have to share with them?	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	These kids really deserve it :) Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. What are your other plans for the day today?	Literally every penny helps these children. And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? i can walk but that is all can do.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before? I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Yes, I absolutely have. I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	Save the Children is a great organization. The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Sounds like they really help education wise. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	They do. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	But they also assist in other ways. How much would you like to donate to the organization?	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I think i will make a donation of $2	Oh so they do more than just help with education. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Thats awesome! What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I couldn't agree more. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	It sure does. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	ANything else I should know about this charity? I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	These kids really deserve it :) Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Literally every penny helps these children. well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I think i will make a donation of $2	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more. I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	It sure does. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	ANything else I should know about this charity? Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	It is a huge movement. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	These kids really deserve it :) Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Literally every penny helps these children. Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Can you tell me more about what they do?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.

They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I will donate 0.05 cents today. ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Thank you :) Have you ever donate for children in your area?

They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.

WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!

Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. You would like to donate a dollar a day?	Literally every penny helps these children. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.

Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	You are AWESOME! That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	I will donate 0.05 cents today. You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Thank you :) Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?

I agree. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	What do you have in mind? Can you tell me more about what they do?	tell to family and friends is a first step They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	And share on social media could be the next step? yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	They get him a house and warm food I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Thats amazing. What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I am glad you were there to help him. SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I would do the same The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Its extremely sad. How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I think you can still make a difference. The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee. How much do we have to share with them?	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho. You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Great idea!! Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Thank for helping to the cause. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Everyone should be responsible of this issue While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	I agree. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me Are you aware of what save te children does?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	But we can always try. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I agree. What is your recommendation on how we can help	What do you have in mind? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	tell to family and friends is a first step They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	And share on social media could be the next step? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	Nope, what do you recommend? I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.

They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. I know we can both feel good about that.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	That would work best for me. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	That way i know where my money is going. Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Is there a minimum to donate? I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.

Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Is there a website where i can donate? Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I'm glad to hear it! And can help these poor children in such a big way.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	What is the easier way? Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. I feel that it would be easy to donate.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Yeah, it does sound good. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I am kind of curious about the details though. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	I think i will make a donation of $2 Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	That's wonderful! Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.

Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.

It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? And share on social media could be the next step?	Yeah, it does sound good. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. I understand but these children have even less than us.	I am kind of curious about the details though. A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.

Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.

Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	That would work best for me. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate All of us should be in this world together.	What is the easier way? I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. Would you like some information about the charity first?

We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	Of course it's your decision, in the end. Great, how much would you like to donate today?	I am kind of curious about the details though. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?

So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Many people should be like that What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy. Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives. I know right, It is a big thing to do.	How many people are currently donating? I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	42% of their funding is from US. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.

The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Unfortunately I can't donate anything right now I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	ohh that is really sad to hear. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	You can donate as little as you want. Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need. This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	I will keep that in mind.

Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	That is very thoughtful of you. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Of course! powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?

I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	I have 10 cents I can give.

20180825-112615_516_live	Hi. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Are you familiar with Save the Children? You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	Hello. Can you tell me more about what they do?	I am not familiar with Save the Children My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Do you currently volunteer with this charity? Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I do. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped. Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Will you consider a donation? It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Is this organization Christian or religious based? Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	It is in terms of values. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished. My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	What more can we do for the least of these? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support? Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide? I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	There is no greater service than to help. Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Maybe. That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	In which countries do they serve? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica. 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Gods love knows no boundaries. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it. can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	You will be blessed. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I just know it! How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	How many children do you estimate are benefited? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year. Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Is this organization a 501(c)(3)? Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Yes it is. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today? In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Where is this organization based? Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They are in Fairfield, CT. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	You can find more information at  URL If only more people were more giving like you!	The children need your help.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities? Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children. I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement. I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference. Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities. I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children? i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	Or do you donate to other ones also? I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	My charity of choice is Save the Children. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I strongly identify with their causes and goals. Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Do you donate money only? Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Or do you also volunteer your time? Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I would be willing to donate 10 cents. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	But I do agree with the points you made in support. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice? Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	They save miniture IG dogs. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I adopted one years ago and she is the best. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	But children's charities are great too. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true? if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That is great! Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Animal charities are pretty great too! In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them. Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	It's really cool. Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I think Disney World participates too. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved. All of us should be in this world together.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	For sure. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I definitely agree with all those points. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Small donations really do add up and make a difference. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	So you charity of choice is Save the Children? Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Or do you donate to other ones also?

National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals. Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Do you donate money only?

I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same. Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	I would be willing to donate 10 cents. Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	But I do agree with the points you made in support. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money? Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice? Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	They save miniture IG dogs. Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.

Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true? ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	That is great! We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Animal charities are pretty great too! Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them. This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	Celebrities often get involved and donate time. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	It's really cool. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I think Disney World participates too. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. And can help these poor children in such a big way.	For sure. I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.

The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited. I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	But I do agree with the points you made in support. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money? And share on social media could be the next step?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause. Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money. Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	I believe it would be a valuable experience. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice? Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group. I think i will make a donation of $2	They save miniture IG dogs. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I adopted one years ago and she is the best. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	But children's charities are great too. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true? What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	That is great! But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Animal charities are pretty great too! You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them. Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	Celebrities often get involved and donate time. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	It's really cool. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I think Disney World participates too. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	For sure. Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I definitely agree with all those points. The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?

I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Thanks for telling me about it.	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!

Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Would you do it now? Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	i get that. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	yeah i know how donation works. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I have 300000 immigrants in my country. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians. Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	where do you came from? I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	charity is a bad for that. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of? The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	yeah i did.

The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	maybe i will do Wow, they really help people all around the world.	That's great to hear. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	What amount were you thinking of donating? Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	It can be as much as you want. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	have you ever done any donation to this charity? Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	yes i sure will do donate.

Even small donations have a huge impact.	have you ever done any donation to this charity? i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	yes i sure will do donate. I see no reason not to help this charity.	after i die i will donate my all.. Do they help our children in the US as well?	How much would you like to donate today? Their website is  URL if you would like to read more

Would you take it?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Would you do it now?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	i get that.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	yeah i know how donation works.	I have 300000 immigrants in my country. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	where do you came from? i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time. I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	charity is a bad for that. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of? Are you going to donate anything at this time?	yeah i did. That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	but it never reached to the people i heard so far Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Would you donate then? In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	maybe i will do I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	That's great to hear. Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	What amount were you thinking of donating? The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It can be as much as you want. The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	have you ever done any donation to this charity? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	yes i sure will do donate. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	after i die i will donate my all.. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	How much would you like to donate today?
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	They're a great charity I support. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I do the same for World Vision. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I sponsor 3 children. How much do we have to share with them?	That's amazing. I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. tell to family and friends is a first step	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I hope more people think like you and me	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	How long have you been donating? Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	For years. You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support. What do you do for work and do you like it?	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I do the same for World Vision. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I sponsor 3 children. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	That's amazing. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	How long have you been donating? That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	For years. You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. I am kind of curious about the details though.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	They're a great charity I support. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I do the same for World Vision. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	I sponsor 3 children. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	That's amazing. It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	How long have you been donating? Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	For years. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	That is good. I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Absolutely. Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	You know what, you've encouraged me. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

They're a great charity I support. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I do the same for World Vision. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I sponsor 3 children. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	That's amazing. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.

I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	That is good. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Absolutely. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.

I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.

No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	Sure. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I would love to help.

I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Great. Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.

I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Probably more. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Hassle free. You could find that out here at this website.	Ok, sounds good. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I'll donate the whole amount. I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Great. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Thanks for sharing. I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. There is a lot of info about the organization there.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It will encourage our friends. They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	Very good. What is your recommendation on how we can help	I glad we can help. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. I understand but these children have even less than us.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	That is good. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Absolutely. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	You know what, you've encouraged me. They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	You want to join me? I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Sure. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I would love to help. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I would love to make a donation today. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	That's amazing. Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Would you like some information about the charity first?	Probably more. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? That way i know where my money is going.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Hassle free. They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Ok, sounds good. Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	I'll donate the whole amount. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Great. My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Thanks for sharing. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I'm going to blog about you later today. Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	It will encourage our friends. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	Very good. No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I glad we can help. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Every bit helps. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Have a wonderful day. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	You. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	You know what, you've encouraged me. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	You want to join me? This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	It won't be much but every penny counts. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Sure. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I would love to help. Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	I would love to make a donation today. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	That's amazing. you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Probably more. Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Hassle free. Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Ok, sounds good. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	I'll donate the whole amount. Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. And can help these poor children in such a big way.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Thanks for sharing. I think i will make a donation of $2	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I'm going to blog about you later today. They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	It will encourage our friends. What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Very good. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I glad we can help. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Every bit helps. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	You've encouraged my heart today. The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	Ditto to you. I would love to help in anyway I can.	Have a great day. I would love to help in anyway I can.	God bless! I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Goodbye. The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	Have a wonderful day. It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	You. I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Enjoy the rest of the day. children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?

I would love to help. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I would love to make a donation today. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	That's amazing. Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Should we give our whole 30 cents? It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Probably more. children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Thanks for sharing. SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It will encourage our friends. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Very good. How much money a year does save the children raise?	I glad we can help.

With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Great. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Thanks for sharing. So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	I'm going to blog about you later today. I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	It will encourage our friends. I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	Very good. from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	I glad we can help. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Every bit helps. Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today. Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Ditto to you. SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Have a great day. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	God bless! SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Goodbye. I understand but these children have even less than us.	Have a wonderful day. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	You. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Enjoy the rest of the day. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. You could find that out here at this website.	Probably more. SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Hassle free. I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Ok, sounds good. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I'll donate the whole amount. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Great. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Thanks for sharing. have you ever done any donation to this charity?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. I am kind of curious about the details though.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I'm going to blog about you later today. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	It will encourage our friends. I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Very good. They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	I glad we can help. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Every bit helps. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Have a great day. That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	God bless! I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Goodbye. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	Have a wonderful day. What was life like for you as a kid?	You. What is your recommendation on how we can help	Enjoy the rest of the day. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.

Hassle free. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Ok, sounds good. I would like to start making a difference today.	I'll donate the whole amount. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	Great. Do you know where I can go to donate?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	Thanks for sharing. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	It will encourage our friends. A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	Very good. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I glad we can help. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Every bit helps. My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	You've encouraged my heart today. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Ditto to you. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Have a great day. I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	God bless! There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	You. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Enjoy the rest of the day. Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?

I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Great. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Thanks for sharing. My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I'm going to blog about you later today. The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	It will encourage our friends. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	Very good. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	I glad we can help. How much do we have to share with them?	Every bit helps. I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	You've encouraged my heart today. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	Ditto to you. Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Have a great day. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	God bless! It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Goodbye. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Have a wonderful day.	You. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Enjoy the rest of the day. i hope you will also donate to make a wish.
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today? It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Not bad. A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity How much do we have to share with them?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	They do everything. Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Food is just one part of it. Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Interesting. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I was unaware. What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Any child that needs help deserves it. Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	What is your recommendation on how we can help That way i know where my money is going.	Any donation will help. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Even if it's small. Have you ever donate for children in your area?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	That makes sense. How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Hello, how are you today?

I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	They do everything. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Food is just one part of it. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Interesting. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I was unaware. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Any child that needs help deserves it. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	What is your recommendation on how we can help How much money a year does save the children raise?	Any donation will help. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Even if it's small. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	That makes sense. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.

Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Hello, how are you today? The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Not bad. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	They do everything. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Food is just one part of it. Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Interesting. If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I was unaware. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Any child that needs help deserves it. ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	What is your recommendation on how we can help My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Any donation will help. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Even if it's small. What do you do for work and do you like it?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	That makes sense. Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? How much do we have to share with them?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Hello, how are you today? I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Not bad. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	They do everything. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Food is just one part of it. How much would you be willing to donate today?	Interesting. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I was unaware. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Any child that needs help deserves it. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	What is your recommendation on how we can help I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Any donation will help. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Even if it's small. You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	That makes sense. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? every other month or so, but not to them	In this particular format, we can only accept money. Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. Save the Children do have a website at  URL	Ok that is good to know. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Hello, how are you today? Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Not bad. That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	They do everything. I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Food is just one part of it. we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	Interesting. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	I was unaware. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Any child that needs help deserves it. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	What is your recommendation on how we can help The money would at least go to a good cause.	Any donation will help. From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Even if it's small. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	That makes sense. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	In this particular format, we can only accept money. This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Ok that is good to know. Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	How would this donation be made? Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hello, how are you today? I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Not bad. Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. It will help these children in a big way.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it. Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Interesting. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I was unaware. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	Any child that needs help deserves it. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	What is your recommendation on how we can help Do they help our children in the US as well?	Any donation will help. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Even if it's small. You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	That makes sense. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? It's not much, but I don't have much money.	In this particular format, we can only accept money. They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Ok that is good to know. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	How would this donation be made? It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I believe you can do it it in the chat. I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Ok that sounds easy enough. What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Hello, how are you today? I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Not bad. You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. i will like to know about the opportunity first	They do everything. Are you aware of what save te children does?	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I was unaware. I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Any child that needs help deserves it. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	What is your recommendation on how we can help OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Any donation will help. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Even if it's small. I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	That makes sense. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	In this particular format, we can only accept money. Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	Ok that is good to know. Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	How would this donation be made? I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I believe you can do it it in the chat. Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Ok that sounds easy enough. I see no reason not to help this charity.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ? the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Hello, how are you today? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Not bad. I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	They do everything. This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Food is just one part of it. Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	Interesting. My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	I was unaware. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Any child that needs help deserves it. i can walk but that is all can do.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help The money would at least go to a good cause.	Any donation will help. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Even if it's small. That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	That makes sense. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	In this particular format, we can only accept money. Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	Ok that is good to know. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? I see no reason not to help this charity.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	How would this donation be made? I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I believe you can do it it in the chat. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Ok that sounds easy enough. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ? The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Hello, how are you today? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Not bad. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Are you aware of what save te children does?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	They do everything. Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Food is just one part of it. You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Interesting. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I was unaware. What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Any child that needs help deserves it. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	What is your recommendation on how we can help How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small. I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	That makes sense. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	In this particular format, we can only accept money. you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	Ok that is good to know. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. Would you like some information about the charity first?	How would this donation be made? without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I believe you can do it it in the chat. It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Ok that sounds easy enough. I see no reason not to help this charity.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Hello, how are you today? I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Not bad. I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	They do everything. I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	Food is just one part of it. I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Interesting. How much money a year does save the children raise?	I was unaware. I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Any child that needs help deserves it. every other month or so, but not to them	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	What is your recommendation on how we can help I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Any donation will help. They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	That makes sense. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	In this particular format, we can only accept money. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.

My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	How would this donation be made? Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I believe you can do it it in the chat. I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	Ok that sounds easy enough. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ? I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Hello, how are you today?

But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. Yes, it really is.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything. Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	Food is just one part of it. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Interesting. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I was unaware. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Any child that needs help deserves it. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	What is your recommendation on how we can help I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Any donation will help. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Even if it's small. Great, how much would you like to donate today?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	That makes sense. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? The money would at least go to a good cause.	In this particular format, we can only accept money. How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Ok that is good to know. How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	How would this donation be made? I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I believe you can do it it in the chat. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Ok that sounds easy enough. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?

I am glad you were there to help him.	no and i regret that i've been so selfish Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Well, don't feel bad. Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	We will donate today. Do they help our children in the US as well?	I propose we stick with our half plan. What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	What do you think? Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	yes i like that plan they are good too, but this one I prefer	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right? No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	OK sounds good. Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	You sure? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	yes i am sure. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	we have a moral responsibility to help I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	Right, nice chatting with you. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I'm proud of us.

20180825-102556_172_live	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Can you tell me more about what they do?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Sounds like they accomplish great things.	Are you thinking of a one time donation?	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	What are your thoughts?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Are we being selfish by keeping half? When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	maybe there are children who may die without this money I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	That's true. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I still haven't decided for sure though. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	?

Well, don't feel bad. My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	We will donate today. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I propose we stick with our half plan. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	What do you think? So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	yes i like that plan They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right? Do you know where I can go to donate?	yes it would be a dollar from each of us Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	OK sounds good. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	You sure? My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	yes i am sure.	we have a moral responsibility to help Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you! Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	How is your day going so far? if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I am doing well. They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. I am kind of curious about the details though.	Have you heard of Save the Children? Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Oh there are quiet a few ways. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	absolutely thank you so much!! When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Children should be our top priority all across the world. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	absolutely thank you so much!! I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Absolutely. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Children should be a priority in the world. What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	They are our future. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	They are our future exactly. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	How long have you been supporting this charity? My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	I would like to start making a difference today. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. How much do we have to share with them?	Thank you! we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	That makes my heart so happy. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	It hurts my heart. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Every penny counts!! Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Well that sounds just great to me! Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

I love getting the word out there on this charity. They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Children should be a priority in the world. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	They are our future. Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	They are our future exactly. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. And share on social media could be the next step?	How long have you been supporting this charity? if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.

Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I would like to start making a difference today. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy. I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	It hurts my heart. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Every penny counts!! Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	Well that sounds just great to me! How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I will spread the word! I am not sure if I have seen that picture.
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	absolutely thank you so much!! When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Absolutely. That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	Children should be a priority in the world. Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	They are our future. How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	They are our future exactly. have you ever done any donation to this charity?	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. The money would at least go to a good cause.	How long have you been supporting this charity? My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I would like to start making a difference today. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Thank you! For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. Would you like to help and donate to them?	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	It hurts my heart. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Every penny counts!! For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Well that sounds just great to me! I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I will spread the word! powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor

This is the only one that comes to mind However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	they are good too, but this one I prefer National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	why is that?

SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	This is the only one that comes to mind You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.

Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	i would not doubt that all. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	So no When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	I understand but these children have even less than us. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	i said I do this for a living. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	What I give away takes food from my mouth. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	You have plenty of rich people out there I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Everyone can help. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	All of us should be in this world together. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? What was life like for you as a kid?	Would you rather donate your time? Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	i cant do that either. WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. I am glad you were there to help him.	i can walk but that is all can do. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I cant stand very long What is your recommendation on how we can help	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	take your penny then I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	are there any charities that you favor? Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	save the children but hurt me Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Would you rather donate your time? Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	i cant do that either. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?

Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	They are a fantastic charity. Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well. How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	That is awesome even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Would you like to help and donate to them? I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. I know we can both feel good about that.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Its because I dont trust non profits okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	That's understandable. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Thank you for your time today.	No thank you for the work that you do Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children? This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I am not sure I am just very biased My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.
20180723-070336_48_live	Hey, how's it going?	Good just another Monday how about yourself?	hahah same here.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Specially the ones concerning children?	Yea what do you got?	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	What was life like for you as a kid?	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I'm very glad to hear that.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full? they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	With no place to live? The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I think that is is awful and sad. Do they help our children in the US as well?	What do we do about it? Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Have you heard about Save the Children? No but I can tell you about the charity!	Other than it mentioned today of course. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	nope I have never heard of it Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	They are a fantastic charity. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	That is awesome I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Would you like to help and donate to them? Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause. I dealt with that more when I was working.	Its because I dont trust non profits Thank you so much for telling me about this.	That's understandable. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Thank you for your time today. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	No thank you for the work that you do I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I am not sure I am just very biased It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause

It is a wonderful charity. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	That is amazing. Do you know where I can go to donate?	Tell me more. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries ! I believe you can do it it in the chat.	I would like to help. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	What would you consider an acceptable contribution? It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month. I feel that it would be easy to donate.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	Where do I sign up? Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children. What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	You can sign up at :  URL the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Yes, I would like to hear more. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I love helping where I can.	Those less fortunate deserve better.	These children die from hunger daily.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Do you donate to this cause as well?	If so, how much do you give?	I do  !	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I think you are a wonderful person.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I admire that !	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	You've been great.
20180826-021724_326_live	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ? I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Yes I have. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	It is a wonderful charity. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	That is amazing. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Tell me more. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?

I would like to help. Wow, they really help people all around the world.	What would you consider an acceptable contribution? Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month. It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Where do I sign up? Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do. Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children. So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	You can sign up at :  URL That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Yes, I would like to hear more. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I love helping where I can. Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Those less fortunate deserve better.

I would like to help. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	What would you consider an acceptable contribution? i hope you will also donate to make a wish.

Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing. Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	Where do I sign up? Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do. Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children. What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?

I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation . you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	I admire that ! I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation ! With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	You've been great. Oh so they do more than just help with education.
20180826-021724_326_live	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Yes I have.	It is a wonderful charity. I am not sure I am just very biased	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	That is amazing. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Tell me more. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries ! It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	I would like to help. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	What would you consider an acceptable contribution? Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month. I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children It will help these children in a big way.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.

Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	You can sign up at :  URL I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.

I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	I think you are a wonderful person. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I admire that ! Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.

Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Wow so generous. They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	i guess were done here	Generous? Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I usually just try to go with half for these things. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that. Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!
