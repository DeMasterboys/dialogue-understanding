What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	What kind of camera do you have?	I have a really old digital camera. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.

20180826-180009_407_live	Hi!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your donation can address such problems. Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Oh wow, shocking news. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization? I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children. Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Over 200k of those kids were in the US. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Thats awesome! Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Are you apart of this organization or just support them? I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity? They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	That is awesome! It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with? St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I am so grateful for your donation. Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	It means alot to this rganization. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Of course, its a great organization to support I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Have you donated to a similar charity? There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Yes, a few times before I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening! There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	Thank you, you too!

A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	Save the Children is a great organization. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Sounds like they really help education wise. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	They do. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	But they also assist in other ways. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.

I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have. They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	Save the Children is a great organization. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Sounds like they really help education wise. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	They do. Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	But they also assist in other ways. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I couldn't agree more. So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. Would you like some information about the charity first?	It sure does. Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	ANything else I should know about this charity? I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	It is a huge movement. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.

I have not heard of Save the Children before. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Sounds like they really help education wise. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	They do. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	But they also assist in other ways. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Thats awesome! I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. tell to family and friends is a first step	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I couldn't agree more. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	It sure does. is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	ANything else I should know about this charity? No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	It is a huge movement. How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.

You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	But they also assist in other ways. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Thats awesome! Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	It sure does. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	ANything else I should know about this charity? The money would at least go to a good cause.	It is a huge movement. How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Thats awesome! OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I couldn't agree more. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity? ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	It is a huge movement. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	These kids really deserve it :) For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

I couldn't agree more. they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It sure does. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement. My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Thank you so much!

I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I couldn't agree more. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	It sure does. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	ANything else I should know about this charity? And share on social media could be the next step?	It is a huge movement. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?

I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	I couldn't agree more. Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	It sure does. Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	ANything else I should know about this charity? I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	It is a huge movement. Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. Do they help our children in the US as well?	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	These kids really deserve it :) I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Literally every penny helps these children. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.

They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Wow, they really help people all around the world. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Are you at all associated with Save the Children? I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I've been a donor and advocate for years. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	It's really easy to get involved. A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	Oh, really? I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion? Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact. They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Do you know where I can go to donate? Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	That'd be fantastic! No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	They actually have an office near me then. Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I'd love to visit one of their facilities. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	There is a lot of info about the organization there. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website. Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	Excellent! You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling? I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	I would definitely like to make a donation! WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Great!	How much would you like to contribute?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll gladly give all of my payment.	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!

I guess I could throw them .10 I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it? what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	It wouldn't hurt to give more. That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.

You know they're worse off than you, right? yes it would be a dollar from each of us	Honestly < do not think so. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..

It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.

I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	I guess I could throw them .10	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it? I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.

Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots.. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.

Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	0k Here is a .25	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school. I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Then why not give some money to these kids too? Would you like some information about the charity first?	They have even less than your daughter has. They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	You can surely spare $2 A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. The money would at least go to a good cause.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2). In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.

How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.

Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Everyone should be responsible of this issue You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I agree. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Exactly!!!. It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	I hope more people think like you and me A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	But we can always try. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well How much would you like to donate to the organization?	I agree.	What do you have in mind? I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	tell to family and friends is a first step Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	And share on social media could be the next step? Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	I agree. therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Exactly!!!. As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I hope more people think like you and me they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	But we can always try. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	I agree. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	And share on social media could be the next step? Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.

I hope more people think like you and me There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	But we can always try. is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well maybe there are children who may die without this money	I agree. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	What do you have in mind? Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	tell to family and friends is a first step They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	And share on social media could be the next step?
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	Nope, what do you recommend? really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	Even small amounts will definitely help I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	What's Save the Children all about? I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Yeah, it does sound good. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	I am kind of curious about the details though. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	I think i will make a donation of $2 they sound like a good charity to donate to	That's wonderful! What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. What is your recommendation on how we can help	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping! To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	That's wonderful! It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	It was great chatting with you. What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	And thanks for helping! 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.

Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	I think i will make a donation of $2 If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	That's wonderful! Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.

I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries. It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. No but I can tell you about the charity!	What can I do to help? So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I'm so glad you asked! Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	Ok how much do you need? Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Isn't that amazing? I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I can't work all day. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I have problems too. Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day. you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... How much do you like to donate to the charity?	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

It is in terms of values. It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children. Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished. I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	What more can we do for the least of these? What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	There is no greater service than to help.	Maybe.	In which countries do they serve?	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Gods love knows no boundaries.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	You will be blessed.	I just know it!	How many children do you estimate are benefited?	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Is this organization a 501(c)(3)?	Yes it is.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Where is this organization based?	They are in Fairfield, CT.	You can find more information at  URL	The children need your help.	Please say yes to their most basic needs.	how many employees are there?	Save the Children employs 1500 people worldwide.	That is how much our help is needed.	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	What is the total revenue?

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	They're a great charity I support. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I sponsor 3 children. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	That's amazing. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	They're a great charity I support. Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Thank you for your time, have a great day.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children. i can walk but that is all can do.	That's amazing. What was life like for you as a kid?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	They're a great charity I support. Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I do the same for World Vision. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing. Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. No thank you for the work that you do	How long have you been donating? I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	For years. It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

They're a great charity I support. they are good too, but this one I prefer	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I do the same for World Vision. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I sponsor 3 children. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	That's amazing. From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.

No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	How long have you been donating? without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	For years. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. All of us should be in this world together.	That is good. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.

Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. How much do we have to share with them?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.

Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	How long have you been donating? WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	For years. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	That is good. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I've heard good things about Save the Children. ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Absolutely. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	You know what, you've encouraged me. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	You want to join me? Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	It won't be much but every penny counts. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating? Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	For years. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	That is good. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. What is your recommendation on how we can help	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Absolutely. I am kind of curious about the details though.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	You know what, you've encouraged me. Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	You want to join me? But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	Sure. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?

I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	That is good. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I've heard good things about Save the Children. Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	You know what, you've encouraged me. I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	You want to join me? I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	It won't be much but every penny counts. This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Sure.

I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Absolutely. I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	You know what, you've encouraged me. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	You want to join me?

Hassle free. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	Ok, sounds good. How much money a year does save the children raise?	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Absolutely. That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	You know what, you've encouraged me. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	You want to join me? They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	It won't be much but every penny counts. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	Sure. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I would love to help. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	Probably more. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Hassle free. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Ok, sounds good. therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I'll donate the whole amount. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	You want to join me? Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	It won't be much but every penny counts. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Sure. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I would love to help. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	I would love to make a donation today. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	That's amazing. All of us should be in this world together.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Hassle free. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	Ok, sounds good. Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I'll donate the whole amount. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	Great. How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me? Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	It won't be much but every penny counts. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Sure. Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	I would love to help. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	I would love to make a donation today. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	That's amazing. I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	Probably more. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Hassle free. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Ok, sounds good. Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I'll donate the whole amount. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	Great. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Thanks for sharing. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	I would love to help. Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I would love to make a donation today. i will like to know about the opportunity first	That's amazing. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Probably more. My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. What do you do for work and do you like it?	Hassle free. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Great. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Thanks for sharing. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I'm going to blog about you later today. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I would love to make a donation today. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	That's amazing. Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Probably more. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? I little bit of know Save the children life.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Hassle free. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	Ok, sounds good. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	Great. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Thanks for sharing. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It will encourage our friends. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Probably more. every other month or so, but not to them	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I'll donate the whole amount. No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Thanks for sharing. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. How much would you be willing to donate today?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I'm going to blog about you later today. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	It will encourage our friends. I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	Very good. I see no reason not to help this charity.	I glad we can help. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Every bit helps. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.

I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Great. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Thanks for sharing. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I'm going to blog about you later today. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	It will encourage our friends. I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	Very good. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	You've encouraged my heart today. Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Ditto to you. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Have a great day. Do you know where I can go to donate?	God bless! Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Goodbye. Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	Have a wonderful day. Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	You. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	Great. I would like to start making a difference today.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Thanks for sharing. What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	I'm going to blog about you later today. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	It will encourage our friends. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Very good. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I glad we can help. If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	You've encouraged my heart today. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Ditto to you. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Have a great day. I would like to start making a difference today.	God bless! Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Goodbye. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Have a wonderful day. Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	You. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Enjoy the rest of the day. That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing. children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I'm going to blog about you later today. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	It will encourage our friends. 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Very good. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I glad we can help. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Every bit helps. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	You've encouraged my heart today. Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Ditto to you.	Have a great day. I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	God bless! Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Goodbye. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Have a wonderful day. you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	You. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Enjoy the rest of the day. I think it is important to do all we can to help children.

So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I'm going to blog about you later today. Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	It will encourage our friends. You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Very good. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I glad we can help. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Every bit helps. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. they are good too, but this one I prefer	You've encouraged my heart today. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	Ditto to you. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Have a great day.	God bless!

Have a wonderful day. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	You. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Enjoy the rest of the day. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.

If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Would you like some information about the charity first?	You've encouraged my heart today. Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Ditto to you. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Have a great day. They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	God bless! I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Goodbye. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Have a wonderful day. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	You. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad. Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	They do everything. With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Food is just one part of it. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	Hello, how are you today? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Not bad. Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	They do everything. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	Food is just one part of it. Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	Interesting. What I give away takes food from my mouth.

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.

They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Children should be our top priority all across the world. Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Oh there are quiet a few ways. Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	absolutely thank you so much!! It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Absolutely. From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. Would you like some information about the charity first?	Children should be a priority in the world. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	They are our future. I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	They are our future exactly. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future. The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	They are our future exactly. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	How long have you been supporting this charity? If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I would like to start making a difference today. i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you! Have you ever donate for children in your area?	That makes my heart so happy. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	It hurts my heart. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Every penny counts!! Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Well that sounds just great to me! So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

I am not sure I am just very biased children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?
20180723-070336_48_live	Hey, how's it going?	Good just another Monday how about yourself?	hahah same here.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Specially the ones concerning children?	Yea what do you got?	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	What was life like for you as a kid?	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I'm very glad to hear that.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	With no place to live?	I think that is is awful and sad.	What do we do about it?	Have you heard about Save the Children?	Other than it mentioned today of course.	nope I have never heard of it	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause	They are a fantastic charity.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	That is awesome Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Would you like to help and donate to them? Are you aware of what save te children does?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause. i will like to know about the opportunity first	Its because I dont trust non profits Do they help our children in the US as well?	That's understandable. Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Thank you for your time today. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	No thank you for the work that you do Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children? There is a lot of info about the organization there.	I am not sure I am just very biased
20180719-175233_833_live	Hey there Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Hey how's it going?	So children's charity then... Can you tell me more about what they do?	Yep. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Do you happen to be a parent? Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	No, not currently. Do they help our children in the US as well?	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	How are they relevant to you? Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you. Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families? I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	Yes I have.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Yeah?	I would think so?

Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I've seen videos that were so heartbreaking	Yea.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Oh really?	Nice!	What can we do to help?	Would you like to help by donating?
