Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	What kind of camera do you have?	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?
20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today?	Hey I'm fine.	How are you doing?	I am doing really good.	So, what are you up to today?	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I can't decide which onne.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	How do you feel about this charity?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Do you know that charity's mission?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I really like their mission.	I really feel badly for the kids.	Don't you?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered?	They are based in CT.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Could you donate anything to them?	yes I can.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!	that is so great.	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I would like to start making a difference today.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	You do not have to do anything else.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?

Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	I am really glad that you donated.	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?

Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	How much do we have to share with them?	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	What are your other plans for the day today?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	That way i know where my money is going.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?

St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?

I think that is a great idea.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Do you have anything like that?

My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Do they help our children in the US as well?	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.

I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I have a really old digital camera.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	How much money a year does save the children raise?	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money

The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	maybe there are children who may die without this money	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.

Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.

Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	I hope more people think like you and me	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?

I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?

I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.

Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	If only more people were more giving like you!	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I hope more people think like you and me	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I think i will make a donation of $2	I am so grateful for your donation.	It means alot to this rganization.

From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	I would love to help in anyway I can.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Do you think you will, too?	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	How much would you give if you weren't?	i would give it all if i weren't	Are you going to donate anything at this time?

You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	Did you have any interesting dreams?	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?

They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	It\'s for "Save the Children"	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	every other month or so, but not to them	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	I may give a few cents	I think that's fair	How about you?	I was thinking I'd give $1.50 or something	That is very generous!
20180903-145436_470_live	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I think that's fair	How about you?	I was thinking I'd give $1.50 or something	That is very generous!
20180903-145436_470_live	Hello	hi!	You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	How much do we have to share with them?	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	That is very generous!
20180903-145436_470_live	Hello	hi!	How's it going?	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.

Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Do you think you will, too?	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I am not sure I am just very biased	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money

There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.

In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.

That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Yea...I am also feel bad that incident...	I fell so bad about it also.	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	It will help these children in a big way.	Yea...It was feel good...what's about you...?	I feel very good donating to this charity.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Yea..It's nice too hear....	Have a nice day!	Have a nice day!

That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Yea...I am also feel bad that incident...	I fell so bad about it also.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	All of us should be in this world together.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.

Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Yea...It was feel good...what's about you...?

I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	How much would you like to donate?	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I feel very good donating to this charity.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Yea..It's nice too hear....	Have a nice day!	Have a nice day!

I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.

Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	What do you do for work and do you like it?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Can you tell me more about what they do?	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?

How much money a year does save the children raise?	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	No but I can tell you about the charity!	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?

You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	These kids really deserve it :)	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?

I couldn't agree more.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I see no reason not to help this charity.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	There's no paying online or entering payment info.

I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Literally every penny helps these children.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

Thank you!	I dealt with that more when I was working.	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	What more can we do for the least of these?	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	maybe there are children who may die without this money	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.

I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	You are AWESOME!	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?

I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	What was life like for you as a kid?	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.

My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.

Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	i can walk but that is all can do.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?

How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	i can walk but that is all can do.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.

Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.

Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

So you charity of choice is Save the Children?

The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!

No thank you for the work that you do	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

20180826-180300_663_live	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.

You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Even small amounts will definitely help	How much do we have to share with them?	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!

What is your recommendation on how we can help	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?

I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.

Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	No but I can tell you about the charity!	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?

Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.

One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Yeah, it does sound good.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!

Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	That's very good since they do so much for children.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	Great, how much would you like to donate today?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	That's wonderful!

I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I am kind of curious about the details though.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	This is the only one that comes to mind	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!

No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	That's great.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Yes, it really is.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	So do you live in the US?	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	LOL	why you laugh.	i am also laughing .didn't tell anything	Just happy to be through with working.

Yes I know that organization.	you have idea donate to that charity	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	ok nice.	how much u pay	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	It doesn't take much to make a difference.	Family all grown up.	ok. than how is you family	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I'm in Arizona where it is very HOT!	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	i am also laughing .didn't tell anything	Just happy to be through with working.

And can help these poor children in such a big way.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	Where are you?	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Just happy to be through with working.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	i am not working.	seeking job	I hope you find something soon.

Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?

They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.

Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	I hope you find something soon.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.

20180827-033451_673_live	Hi there, how are you this morning?	ya fine morning what about you	Good thanks.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Have you heard of them?	Yes I know that organization.	you have idea donate to that charity	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	ok nice.	how much u pay	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	It doesn't take much to make a difference.	Family all grown up.	ok. than how is you family	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	oh ok. i love children's very much.	so i donate that charity	You will?	That's great.	I know we can both feel good about that.	So do you live in the US?	yes .	where are you	I'm in Arizona where it is very HOT!	Where are you?	VANCOUVER.	WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB	Van couver in the US?	Is that in Washington state?	I don't work cause I already retired.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke

Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.
20180825-043516_619_live	Hi, I hope you are well today!	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Are you familiar with them?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.

Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.

How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?

Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Are you familiar with them?	No I am not.	Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Have an awesome day and thank you again!	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.

No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	The web address is  URL
20180825-112615_516_live	Hi.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Is this organization Christian or religious based?	It is in terms of values.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	What more can we do for the least of these?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	There is no greater service than to help.	Maybe.	In which countries do they serve?	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Gods love knows no boundaries.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	You will be blessed.	I just know it!	How many children do you estimate are benefited?	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Is this organization a 501(c)(3)?	Yes it is.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Where is this organization based?	They are in Fairfield, CT.	You can find more information at  URL	The children need your help.	Please say yes to their most basic needs.	how many employees are there?	Save the Children employs 1500 people worldwide.	That is how much our help is needed.	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	What is the total revenue?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?
20180825-112615_516_live	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Are you familiar with Save the Children?	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	What was life like for you as a kid?	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Is this organization a 501(c)(3)?	Yes it is.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Where is this organization based?	They are in Fairfield, CT.	You can find more information at  URL	The children need your help.	Please say yes to their most basic needs.	how many employees are there?	Save the Children employs 1500 people worldwide.

I am not familiar with Save the Children	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Do you currently volunteer with this charity?	I do.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.

But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There is no greater service than to help.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.

Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!

I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I just know it!	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Yes it is.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Yes, it really is.

Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I little bit of know Save the children life.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.

Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	They save miniture IG dogs.

That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.

However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.

Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.

20180825-080131_220_live	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.

I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.

Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Thanks for telling me about it.	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to you!	I hope you get lots of donations.

Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.
20180826-020520_686_live	Hello!	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Would you take it?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Would you do it now?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	i get that.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	yeah i know how donation works.	I have 300000 immigrants in my country.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa	where do you came from?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	charity is a bad for that.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	yeah i did.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	How much would you like to donate today?
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.

No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	That's amazing.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?

Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.

So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.

I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	How much do we have to share with them?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?

URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	How much do we have to share with them?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.

Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	i can walk but that is all can do.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.

Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	No thank you for the work that you do	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	You want to join me?	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	It won't be much but every penny counts.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.

I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	All of us should be in this world together.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.

When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	That's amazing.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Can you tell me more about what they do?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.

That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Great.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	All of us should be in this world together.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I dealt with that more when I was working.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.

Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?

I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.

It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I would like to start making a difference today.	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.

I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Do you know where I can go to donate?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I know we can both feel good about that.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	How much do we have to share with them?	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Hassle free.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It will encourage our friends.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.

Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.

It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

20180723-052203_936_live	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	I know we can both feel good about that.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.

Have you heard of Save the Children?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?

If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Children should be a priority in the world.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.

Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.

I know right, It is a big thing to do.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.

Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!

The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.

I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.

Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.

Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.

Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.

I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	With no place to live?	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	How much money a year does save the children raise?

Yea what do you got?	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Have you heard about Save the Children?	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Its because I dont trust non profits	That's understandable.

Yea what do you got?	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Other than it mentioned today of course.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Its because I dont trust non profits	That's understandable.	Thank you for your time today.

It's not much, but I don't have much money.	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	tell to family and friends is a first step	I see no reason not to help this charity.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	That's understandable.	Thank you for your time today.	No thank you for the work that you do	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I am not sure I am just very biased

It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I.

They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	Yes I have.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Yeah?	I would think so?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	But I"m always willing to help!	We definitely need more people like you in the world.

20180826-021724_326_live	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Yes I have.	It is a wonderful charity.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	That is amazing.	Tell me more.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I would like to help.	What would you consider an acceptable contribution?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Where do I sign up?	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	You can sign up at :  URL	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	Yes, I would like to hear more.	I love helping where I can.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Do you know where I can go to donate?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	I admire that !	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.

These children die from hunger daily.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.
20180824-020419_695_live	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.

I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	What type of agreement are they talking about?	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	First, is your reward contingent on my donating?	Yes it is	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	You can donate any amount you like.	However big or small.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Wow so generous.	i guess were done here	Generous?

How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	How much would you be willing to donate today?	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Do you know where I can go to donate?

20180824-020419_695_live	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I would love to help in anyway I can.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?

Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	You can donate any amount you like.	However big or small.
