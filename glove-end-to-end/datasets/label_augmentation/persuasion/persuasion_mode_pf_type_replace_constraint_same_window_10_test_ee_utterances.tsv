Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	Thats awesome!

You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	No but I can tell you about the charity!	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.

Yes, a few times before	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Thank you, you too!
20180826-180009_407_live	Hi!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	It will help these children in a big way.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	tell to family and friends is a first step	This is the only one that comes to mind	Of course, its a great organization to support	Have you donated to a similar charity?

Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Thank you, you too!

I know right, It is a big thing to do.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.

The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	All of us should be in this world together.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I am glad you were there to help him.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I think i will make a donation of $2	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.

Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	It is the least we can do.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	It is the least we can do.

Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	It is the least we can do.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	I agree.	That sounds like a great idea!	How much am I allowed to donate?	Up to your whole 2 bucks!!	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	No, thank you!	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	That wonderful!

20180903-163331_887_live	Hey, do you care about hungry children?	Sure	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	tell to family and friends is a first step	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I am kind of curious about the details though.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	That sounds like a great idea!	How much am I allowed to donate?	Up to your whole 2 bucks!!	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	No, thank you!	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	No, we're done!	Thanks again.	Thank you very much!
20180903-163331_887_live	Hey, do you care about hungry children?	Sure	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Yes, I have.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	No, thank you!	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?

No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	But it's been mostly local church related activities.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	every other month or so, but not to them	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	No, thank you!	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	No, we're done!	Thanks again.	Thank you very much!

No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Oh okay.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I am not sure I am just very biased	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	Okay, that sounds great!  Thanks!	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	No, we're done!	Thanks again.	Thank you very much!

Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Oh okay.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Point taken.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Thank you very much!

Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	That sounds like a great idea!

I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	How much am I allowed to donate?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.

One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.

Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I agree.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	What do you have in mind?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US

Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	And share on social media could be the next step?
20180826-180300_663_live	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Hello	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!
20180826-180300_663_live	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

20180826-180300_663_live	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	i will like to know about the opportunity first	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	What's Save the Children all about?	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!

Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	i can walk but that is all can do.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I little bit of know Save the children life.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	What do you do for work and do you like it?	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	That would work best for me.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	I hope more people think like you and me	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.

Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I am not sure I am just very biased	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.

Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Is there a website where i can donate?	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !

If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I would love to help in anyway I can.

I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.

Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Ok how much do you need?	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	All of us should be in this world together.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.

Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Are you familiar with them?	And share on social media could be the next step?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Have an awesome day and thank you again!

20180825-081859_875_live	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.

Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.

Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.
20180825-081859_875_live	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	i can walk but that is all can do.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I hope more people think like you and me	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	I am glad you were there to help him.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	This is the only one that comes to mind	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.
20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I think i will make a donation of $2	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.

I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How much do we have to share with them?	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	they sound like a good charity to donate to	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Do you donate money only?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.

It made me both angry and sad.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I am glad you were there to help him.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.

The money would at least go to a good cause.	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	Wonderful!	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Sounds good.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Thanks for telling me about it.	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to you!	I hope you get lots of donations.

I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money
20180825-080131_220_live	Hello there!	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Hi.	It sounds familiar but I'm not sure.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's a great organization!	Is it reputable?	Certainly!	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	Wonderful!	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Sounds good.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	I would like to start making a difference today.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Great, how much would you like to donate today?	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.

A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	Good luck to you!	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!

These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	I hope you get lots of donations.
20180826-020520_686_live	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa	where do you came from?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	charity is a bad for that.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	yeah i did.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Would you donate then?	maybe i will do	That's great to hear.	What amount were you thinking of donating?	It can be as much as you want.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	yes i sure will do donate.	after i die i will donate my all..	How much would you like to donate today?
20180826-020520_686_live	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	And share on social media could be the next step?	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	charity is a bad for that.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	yeah i did.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.

20180826-020520_686_live	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	i can walk but that is all can do.	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	i get that.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	yeah i did.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.

20180826-020520_686_live	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	I hope more people think like you and me	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	yeah i know how donation works.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?

I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	they are good too, but this one I prefer	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	after i die i will donate my all..	What are your other plans for the day today?
20180825-055427_625_live	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Are you aware of what save te children does?	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	No but I can tell you about the charity!	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	I do the same for World Vision.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.

20180825-055427_625_live	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I sponsor 3 children.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	What are your other plans for the day today?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.

I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	That way i know where my money is going.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.

There are ways to make a difference for sure.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	I know we can both feel good about that.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	You could find that out here at this website.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	they sound like a good charity to donate to	How much would you be willing to donate today?	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	How long have you been donating?	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I would love to help in anyway I can.

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	How much do we have to share with them?	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I'll donate the whole amount.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	every other month or so, but not to them	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.

That's amazing.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	You can decide how much you want to donate.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Great.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	It will help these children in a big way.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	every other month or so, but not to them	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	No but I can tell you about the charity!	What do you do for work and do you like it?	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	That's very good since they do so much for children.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	This is the only one that comes to mind	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	God bless!	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I dealt with that more when I was working.

I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I know we can both feel good about that.	This is the only one that comes to mind	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	You.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe

20180808-081317_142_live	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	If only more people were more giving like you!	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.

Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Can you tell me more about what they do?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.

Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Do you know where I can go to donate?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?

Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	How would this donation be made?	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	every other month or so, but not to them	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.

Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	How much would you be willing to donate today?	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	All of us should be in this world together.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	What are your other plans for the day today?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	They are our future exactly.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	What more can we do for the least of these?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	That makes my heart so happy.

Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	I would like to start making a difference today.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Well that sounds just great to me!

I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Would you like to help and donate to them?	I understand but these children have even less than us.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!

You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.

Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	It hurts my heart.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	I dealt with that more when I was working.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.

HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Well that sounds just great to me!	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself

What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

No thank you for the work that you do	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	I little bit of know Save the children life.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	i would not doubt that all.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.

I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	So no	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?

I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.

There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	You have plenty of rich people out there	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

So no	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	i cant do that either.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	And share on social media could be the next step?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Would you like some information about the charity first?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?

But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	hope things get better for you!

20180723-070336_48_live	Hey, how's it going?	Good just another Monday how about yourself?	hahah same here.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Specially the ones concerning children?	Yea what do you got?	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	What was life like for you as a kid?	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	If only more people were more giving like you!	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	do you know what save the children fund does?	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	nope I have never heard of it	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Its because I dont trust non profits	That's understandable.

No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Are you aware of what save te children does?	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Thank you for your time today.

I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.

I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	The money would at least go to a good cause.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	Oh really?	I am not sure I am just very biased	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c

It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.

Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.

Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Where do I sign up?	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.
