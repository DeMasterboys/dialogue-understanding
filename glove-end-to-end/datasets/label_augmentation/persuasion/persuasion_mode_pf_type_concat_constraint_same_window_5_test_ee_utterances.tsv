However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	But they also assist in other ways. they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. Save the Children do have a website at  URL	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does. therefore we should do our best to make that happen	ANything else I should know about this charity? Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	It is a huge movement. Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	These kids really deserve it :) For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I.

No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Then why not give some money to these kids too? How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	They have even less than your daughter has. It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	You can surely spare $2 I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.

20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	Thats amazing. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I am glad you were there to help him. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I would do the same without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I think you can still make a difference. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? What was life like for you as a kid?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff. I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.

20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I agree. Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	What do you have in mind? ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	tell to family and friends is a first step So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	And share on social media could be the next step?
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	Nope, what do you recommend? i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Even small amounts will definitely help But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello! I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Are you aware of Save the Children organization? Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children. No thank you for the work that you do	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization. Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	That is a great cause. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Are you aware of what save te children does?	They're a great charity I support. Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I sponsor 3 children. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	That's amazing. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.

Sure. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	I would love to help. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing. Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Probably more. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	I would love to make a donation today. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	That's amazing. tell to family and friends is a first step	Should we give our whole 30 cents? No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Hassle free. So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	Ok, sounds good. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.

Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I'm going to blog about you later today. yes it would be a dollar from each of us	It will encourage our friends. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Very good.	I glad we can help. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Every bit helps. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	You've encouraged my heart today. Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	I'm going to blog about you later today. No but I can tell you about the charity!	It will encourage our friends. I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Very good. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	You've encouraged my heart today. That's very good since they do so much for children.	Ditto to you. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad. Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! It will help these children in a big way.	Hello, how are you today? Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Not bad. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today? The money would at least go to a good cause.	Not bad. I know right, It is a big thing to do.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today? Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far? So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I am doing well. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. Great, how much would you like to donate today?	Have you heard of Save the Children? Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy. Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	It hurts my heart. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!! Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Well that sounds just great to me! i can walk but that is all can do.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I will spread the word!

I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	they are good too, but this one I prefer $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	why is that? okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	that's a fair point I see no reason not to help this charity.	are you still there?	yes! i said that's a fair point.	save the children is a good choice.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? do you know what save the children fund does?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children. So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	Have you heard of them? I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! I hope more people think like you and me	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	i suppose WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	My favorite charity is Save The Children. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Have you heard of them? Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.

Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.

Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	i would not doubt that all. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.

I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	i said I do this for a living. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help. The money would at least go to a good cause.	All of us should be in this world together. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

Would you rather donate your time? What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	i cant do that either. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.

I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. maybe there are children who may die without this money	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.

Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	take your penny then Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.

Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause	They are a fantastic charity.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well. Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	That is awesome WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Would you like to help and donate to them? I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Its because I dont trust non profits if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's understandable. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Thank you for your time today. I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	No thank you for the work that you do OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I am not sure I am just very biased

Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	What type of agreement are they talking about?	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	First, is your reward contingent on my donating?	Yes it is	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	You can donate any amount you like.	However big or small.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Wow so generous. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	i guess were done here How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Generous? Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that. yes it would be a dollar from each of us
