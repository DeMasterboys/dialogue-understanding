Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	I see no reason not to help this charity.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?

I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.

20180825-070900_49_live	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	I really feel badly for the kids.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?

Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.

How do you feel about this charity?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Do you know that charity's mission?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I really like their mission.	I really feel badly for the kids.	Don't you?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered?	They are based in CT.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Could you donate anything to them?	yes I can.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I see no reason not to help this charity.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!

I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Do they help our children in the US as well?

I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.

Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	People like you make the world better.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.

Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	It means alot to this rganization.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me

Thank you for your time, have a great day.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?

Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	That way i know where my money is going.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Have you donated to a similar charity?

Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.
20180808-030454_242_live	Hello, how are you today?	I think i will make a donation of $2	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I am glad you were there to help him.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	What was life like for you as a kid?	What do you do for work and do you like it?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	some people donate whole their life and time.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	No, itt will be anonymously.	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	whetehr i acn trust this charity?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	there is no other children charity ?	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I am not a member, but i donate.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	There are a few for sure.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Thank you for your time and effort.

20180808-030454_242_live	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I see, same here for me.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	How much do we have to share with them?	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	some people donate whole their life and time.

The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.

There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.

Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I like that they are transparent.

I am also going to donate .15 cents.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Do you know where I can go to donate?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment

You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	What is your recommendation on how we can help	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.

Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Save the Children is a great organization.	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.

I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.

Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.

It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I am kind of curious about the details though.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.

St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	How much money a year does save the children raise?	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	I am glad you were there to help him.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.

I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.

Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.

Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	What is your recommendation on how we can help	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?

It adds to their credibility.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.

You would like to donate a dollar a day?	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	What was life like for you as a kid?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?

You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.

In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.

They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	What more can we do for the least of these?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I dealt with that more when I was working.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I hope more people think like you and me	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	It will help these children in a big way.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.

It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	I am not sure I am just very biased	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.

I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	You are AWESOME!	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.

They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	maybe there are children who may die without this money	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.

It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	How much do we have to share with them?	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Do they help our children in the US as well?	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	Are you aware of what save te children does?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Thank you :)	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.

20180903-163331_887_live	Hey, do you care about hungry children?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	I agree.	That sounds like a great idea!	How much am I allowed to donate?	Up to your whole 2 bucks!!	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	No, thank you!	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	No, we're done!	Thanks again.	Thank you very much!
20180903-163331_887_live	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	You could find that out here at this website.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	That sounds like a great idea!	How much am I allowed to donate?	Up to your whole 2 bucks!!	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	No, thank you!	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	No, we're done!	Thanks again.	Thank you very much!
20180903-163331_887_live	tell to family and friends is a first step	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	I think i will make a donation of $2	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I think i will make a donation of $2	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Up to your whole 2 bucks!!	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	No, thank you!	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	No, we're done!	Thanks again.	Thank you very much!
20180903-163331_887_live	Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.

I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I understand but these children have even less than us.	Thank you for your time, have a great day.

The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.

I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."

I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?

Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.

Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.

I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	That way i know where my money is going.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.

WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.

Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?
20180903-163331_887_live	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.

Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	That way i know where my money is going.

I think i will make a donation of $2	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?

No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!

Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I am glad you were there to help him.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations

People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.

I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	I see no reason not to help this charity.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.

20180723-100855_385_live	Hi...	how are you today?	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Great, how much would you like to donate today?	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.

National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.

Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.

I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	Of course!	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day

Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.

I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	That way i know where my money is going.	That is very thoughtful of you.

It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.

Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?
20180827-033451_673_live	Hi there, how are you this morning?	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	That's great.	I know we can both feel good about that.	So do you live in the US?	yes .	where are you	I'm in Arizona where it is very HOT!	Where are you?	VANCOUVER.	WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB	Van couver in the US?	Is that in Washington state?	I don't work cause I already retired.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	LOL	why you laugh.	i am also laughing .didn't tell anything	Just happy to be through with working.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	i am not working.	seeking job	I hope you find something soon.	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	God bless and good morning.
20180827-033451_673_live	That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Good thanks.

Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	The money would at least go to a good cause.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	So do you live in the US?	yes .	where are you	I'm in Arizona where it is very HOT!	Where are you?	VANCOUVER.

I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	I'm in Arizona where it is very HOT!	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?

20180827-033451_673_live	Hi there, how are you this morning?	ya fine morning what about you	Good thanks.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Have you heard of them?	Yes I know that organization.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I am glad you were there to help him.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	Where are you?	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	God bless and good morning.
20180827-033451_673_live	Hi there, how are you this morning?	ya fine morning what about you	Good thanks.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Have you heard of them?	Yes I know that organization.	you have idea donate to that charity	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Van couver in the US?	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.

I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	Is that in Washington state?	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	The money would at least go to a good cause.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	The money would at least go to a good cause.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	How much do we have to share with them?

He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?

They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	ok nice.	how much u pay	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.

I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I don't work cause I already retired.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?

You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	LOL	Do they help our children in the US as well?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.

Family all grown up.	ok. than how is you family	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.

Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!

Family all grown up.	ok. than how is you family	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?

In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I hope you find something soon.	Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!

Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.

I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.

My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.

I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.

There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Are you aware of what save te children does?

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I think i will make a donation of $2	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	No but I can tell you about the charity!	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	What is the total revenue?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?
20180825-112615_516_live	Hi.	Are you familiar with Save the Children?	Hello.	I am not familiar with Save the Children	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Do they help our children in the US as well?	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?
20180825-112615_516_live	Hi.	Are you familiar with Save the Children?	Hello.	I am not familiar with Save the Children	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	You will be blessed.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	I am glad you were there to help him.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	No but I can tell you about the charity!

Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I just know it!	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?

Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home

And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.

It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Please say yes to their most basic needs.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	What was life like for you as a kid?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.

I am not familiar with Save the Children	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Do you currently volunteer with this charity?	I do.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Will you consider a donation?	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.

It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	There is no greater service than to help.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	i can walk but that is all can do.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Are you aware of what save te children does?	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Save the Children employs 1500 people worldwide.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	they sound like a good charity to donate to	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence

Maybe.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	I am kind of curious about the details though.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	If only more people were more giving like you!	That is how much our help is needed.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.

That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Are you aware of what save te children does?	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.

I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."

I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	All of us should be in this world together.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.

For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.
20180825-064001_264_live	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.

I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I know we can both feel good about that.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	i can walk but that is all can do.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.

Can I tell you about a charity important to me?

Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.

Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.

So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?

I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	It will help these children in a big way.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.

I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I know we can both feel good about that.	And share on social media could be the next step?	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.

If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Thanks for telling me about it.	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to you!

For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?

They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.

St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.
20180826-020520_686_live	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	every other month or so, but not to them	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?
20180826-020520_686_live	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!
20180826-020520_686_live	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.

Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Do they help our children in the US as well?	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	they sound like a good charity to donate to	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.

20180826-020520_686_live	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	I am not sure I am just very biased	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	Can you tell me more about what they do?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.

Wow, they really help people all around the world.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.

Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	I would like to start making a difference today.	All of us should be in this world together.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?

Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	What more can we do for the least of these?	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.

Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	What was life like for you as a kid?	I understand but these children have even less than us.	Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Do they help our children in the US as well?	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	do you know what save the children fund does?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	No but I can tell you about the charity!	How much would you be willing to donate today?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	That wonderful!

I have not heard of Save the Children before.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	You want to join me?	How much would you be willing to donate today?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!

I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.

When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	That way i know where my money is going.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.

I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.

It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.

Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.

I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?

You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.

Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.

Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	Hassle free.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I would like to start making a difference today.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	they are good too, but this one I prefer	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?

Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	I am glad you were there to help him.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	All of us should be in this world together.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.

It won't be much but every penny counts.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Do you know where I can go to donate?	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	That way i know where my money is going.

What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?

The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	It will encourage our friends.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.

We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.

It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	I am kind of curious about the details though.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	You've encouraged my heart today.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.

It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Goodbye.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.

What specific causes the charity donate to?	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.

Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Would you like to help and donate to them?	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Absolutely.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.

You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!

Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I little bit of know Save the children life.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.

Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.

I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.

Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.

That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	save the children is a good choice.

I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Do they help our children in the US as well?
20180723-122005_335_live	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.

What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?
20180723-122005_335_live	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.

WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?
20180723-122005_335_live	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	How much do we have to share with them?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.

Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?

I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I am not sure I am just very biased	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	All of us should be in this world together.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I love getting the word out there on this charity.

Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.

I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	Thank you very much, have a nice day.
20180827-032811_159_live	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	No thank you for the work that you do	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	I am not sure I am just very biased	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	That way i know where my money is going.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	That way i know where my money is going.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	And share on social media could be the next step?	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?
20180827-032811_159_live	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	They are also a reputable charity.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	You could find that out here at this website.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.
20180827-032811_159_live	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	I am glad you were there to help him.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	Do you donate to other charities also?	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I would love to help in anyway I can.	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	And share on social media could be the next step?	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me
20180827-032811_159_live	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	How much would you be willing to donate today?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.

I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?

I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Thank you for your time today.

Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Even a couple of cents.	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support.

Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.
