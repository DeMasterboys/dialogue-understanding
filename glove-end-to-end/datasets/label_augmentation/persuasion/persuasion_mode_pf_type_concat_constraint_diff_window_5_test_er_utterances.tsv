Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your donation can address such problems.	Oh wow, shocking news.	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children. It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Over 200k of those kids were in the US. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Thats awesome! It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Are you apart of this organization or just support them? Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity? Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c What is your recommendation on how we can help	That is awesome! Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with? can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I am so grateful for your donation.	It means alot to this rganization.	Of course, its a great organization to support	Have you donated to a similar charity?	Yes, a few times before	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Thank you, you too!

20180826-062736_188_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you all	Hello how are	sorry it cut me off...	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	Yes pleas do	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	Sounds like a good charity.	What countries do they provide service to?	mainly children in developing countries.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	Donations are their main source of income.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	however any donation helps, even just 1 dollar.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	86% goes towards the services...	the rest is used mainly for fundraising efforts	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	Would you consider making a donation? Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies? I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Google, Disney, target and paypal You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before? Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Yes, I absolutely have. Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	Save the Children is a great organization. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

Oh so they do more than just help with education. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Thats awesome! That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. I think i will make a donation of $2	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. How much money a year does save the children raise?	I couldn't agree more. That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. You would like to donate a dollar a day?	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.

I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time? Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	I guess I could throw them .10 I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it? Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	It wouldn't hurt to give more.

Honestly < do not think so. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots.. is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	0k Here is a .25	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	They have even less than your daughter has.	You can surely spare $2	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.

He has no parents ,no one that cares about him It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Thats very sweet of you. have you ever done any donation to this charity?	What did you get him? I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I get in touch with the Save the Children program. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing. Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	I am glad you were there to help him. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I would do the same I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?

If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	But we can always try. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Nope, what do you recommend? Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Hello okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend? Do you know where I can go to donate?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Even small amounts will definitely help You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	Hello I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Nope, what do you recommend? The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Even small amounts will definitely help I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	What's Save the Children all about? Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. I know we can both feel good about that.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Yeah, it does sound good. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	Of course it's your decision, in the end. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	I am kind of curious about the details though. There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	I think i will make a donation of $2 I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	That's wonderful! Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Ok how much do you need? No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! There is a lot of info about the organization there.	Isn't that amazing? I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	I can't work all day. SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Are you familiar with them?	No I am not.	Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?

But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today. I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!

I am so happy I can help. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Thank you again. For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	They're a great charity I support. I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. What was life like for you as a kid?	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. How much money a year does save the children raise?	I do the same for World Vision. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.

When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I've heard good things about Save the Children. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	You know what, you've encouraged me. Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	You want to join me? They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Sure. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I would love to help. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I would love to make a donation today. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	That's amazing. It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	Probably more. It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.

I would love to help. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I would love to make a donation today. I dealt with that more when I was working.	That's amazing. Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Should we give our whole 30 cents? You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more. every other month or so, but not to them	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Hassle free. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.

I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Ok, sounds good. What is your recommendation on how we can help	I'll donate the whole amount. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.

I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Thanks for sharing. Can you tell me more about what they do?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. I know right, It is a big thing to do.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends. I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	Very good. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I glad we can help. Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	Every bit helps. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you! I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	How is your day going so far? Do they help our children in the US as well?	I am doing well. I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Have you heard of Save the Children? It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Children should be our top priority all across the world. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Oh there are quiet a few ways. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	I would like to start making a difference today. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Thank you! When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	It hurts my heart. I dealt with that more when I was working.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	That makes my heart so happy. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.

They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	take your penny then Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times. It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	i have my own low times. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	constant pain in my feet I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	hope things get better for you!
