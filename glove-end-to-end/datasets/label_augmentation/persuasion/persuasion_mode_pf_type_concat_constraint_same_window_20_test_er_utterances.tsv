20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today?	Hey I'm fine. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	How are you doing? Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I am doing really good. Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	So, what are you up to today? Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I can't decide which onne. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children. I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	How do you feel about this charity? Are you aware of what save te children does?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Do you know that charity's mission? Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	I really like their mission. How much would you like to donate to the organization?	I really feel badly for the kids. Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Don't you? Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	They are based in CT. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Could you donate anything to them?	yes I can.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	no this is my first time.	what do I do now?	You do not have to do anything else.	I am really glad that you donated.	What are your other plans for the day today?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	What kind of camera do you have?	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?
20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today? We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Hey I'm fine. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	How are you doing? So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I am doing really good.	So, what are you up to today? I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I can't decide which onne. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.

Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Do you know that charity's mission? How much money a year does save the children raise?

Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? Can you tell me more about what they do?	They are based in CT. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Could you donate anything to them? It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	yes I can. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.

I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.

They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I really like their mission.	I really feel badly for the kids. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	Don't you? Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. I little bit of know Save the children life.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? How much money a year does save the children raise?	They are based in CT. I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Could you donate anything to them? Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	yes I can. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I can donate 10 dollars. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Wow! Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	that is so great. URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	Thank you so much. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes? Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	OH, yeah food please. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Gotta feed the hungry first I am not sure I am just very biased	Yes! Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	I think that is a great idea. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	no this is my first time. And share on social media could be the next step?	what do I do now? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	You do not have to do anything else. How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	I am really glad that you donated. cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	What are your other plans for the day today? cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	What kind of camera do you have? I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I have a really old digital camera. Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? I know we can both feel good about that.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Do you have anything like that? If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.

They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I couldn't agree more. This is the only one that comes to mind	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. A productive activity to fill your free time with.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello! This is the only one that comes to mind	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before? Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization. Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	I have not heard of Save the Children before. Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	Sounds like they really help education wise. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	They do. The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	But they also assist in other ways. From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Thats awesome! Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I couldn't agree more. Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. A productive activity to fill your free time with.	It sure does. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	ANything else I should know about this charity? How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	It is a huge movement. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	But they also assist in other ways. That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Thats awesome! I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I couldn't agree more. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	It sure does. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	ANything else I should know about this charity? How much money a year does save the children raise?	It is a huge movement. they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	These kids really deserve it :) So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Literally every penny helps these children. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

Sounds like they really help education wise. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	They do.

Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	Oh so they do more than just help with education. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Thats awesome! I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.

You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	Literally every penny helps these children. I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.

I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before? So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Yes, I absolutely have. My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Save the Children is a great organization. they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Sounds like they really help education wise. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	They do. I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	But they also assist in other ways. Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Thats awesome! The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I couldn't agree more. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	It sure does. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	ANything else I should know about this charity? No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	These kids really deserve it :) Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Literally every penny helps these children. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. All of us should be in this world together.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?

Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Sounds like they really help education wise. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	They do. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	But they also assist in other ways. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Thats awesome! That way i know where my money is going.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I couldn't agree more. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	It sure does. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	ANything else I should know about this charity? Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	It is a huge movement. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :) Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Literally every penny helps these children. All of us should be in this world together.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. Children should be our top priority all across the world.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.

Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise. Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	They do. You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	But they also assist in other ways. We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Thats awesome! they sound like a good charity to donate to	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I couldn't agree more. Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	It sure does. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	ANything else I should know about this charity? Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	It is a huge movement. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Literally every penny helps these children. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	You are AWESOME! What more can we do for the least of these?	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I will donate 0.05 cents today. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Thats awesome! its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I couldn't agree more. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	It sure does. I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	ANything else I should know about this charity? Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	It is a huge movement. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	I couldn't agree more. It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	It sure does. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	ANything else I should know about this charity? It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	It is a huge movement. They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	These kids really deserve it :) Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Literally every penny helps these children. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. All of us should be in this world together.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	You are AWESOME! Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? Great, how much would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I will donate 0.05 cents today. I think i will make a donation of $2	Thank you :) We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I couldn't agree more. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	It sure does. I would love to help in anyway I can.	ANything else I should know about this charity? Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	It is a huge movement. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. I see no reason not to help this charity.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	These kids really deserve it :) I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	Literally every penny helps these children. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. I understand but these children have even less than us.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	You are AWESOME! You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? What more can we do for the least of these?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I will donate 0.05 cents today. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Thank you :) I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) tell to family and friends is a first step	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! but it never reached to the people i heard so far

Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I couldn't agree more. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	It sure does. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	ANything else I should know about this charity? Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	It is a huge movement. It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Literally every penny helps these children. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I.

Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?

WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	These kids really deserve it :) In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Do you know where I can go to donate?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	Literally every penny helps these children. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I will donate 0.05 cents today. I think i will make a donation of $2	Thank you :) HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	These kids really deserve it :) Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Literally every penny helps these children. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?

YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	You are AWESOME! Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.

You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Literally every penny helps these children. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.

Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	You are AWESOME! What more can we do for the least of these?	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today. I think i will make a donation of $2	Thank you :) What do you do for work and do you like it?	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) No but I can tell you about the charity!	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! Would you like to help and donate to them?

I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	Literally every penny helps these children. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	You are AWESOME! That's very good since they do so much for children.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? What are your other plans for the day today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) I am kind of curious about the details though.	I will donate 0.05 cents today. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?

20180903-163331_887_live	Hey, do you care about hungry children?	Sure I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights? Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world. save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence. That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group? Would you like some information about the charity first?	Oh okay. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens? What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Point taken. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	It is the least we can do. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	The money would at least go to a good cause. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	It is the least we can do. Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	The money would at least go to a good cause. I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Yes, I have. I am not sure I am just very biased	But it's been mostly local church related activities. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..

We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.

You can surely spare $2 Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.

20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more. When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Have you ever donate for children in your area? Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year. I dealt with that more when I was working.	And a few other local charities specifically for children. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Have you ever donated to children? If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Yes, I have. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	I remember a kid that lives on the streets. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	Thats very sweet of you. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	What did you get him? Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	They get him a house and warm food For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Thats amazing. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I am glad you were there to help him. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I would do the same But I do agree with the points you made in support.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Its extremely sad. WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I think you can still make a difference. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?

I couldn't agree more. Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	Have you ever donate for children in your area? What was life like for you as a kid?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	And a few other local charities specifically for children. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Have you ever donated to children? from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets. A productive activity to fill your free time with.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Thats very sweet of you. I little bit of know Save the children life.	What did you get him? Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	They get him a house and warm food I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	Thats amazing. I dealt with that more when I was working.	I am glad you were there to help him. When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	I would do the same WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	Its extremely sad. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I think you can still make a difference. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee. I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Great idea!! Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Thank for helping to the cause. Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I couldn't agree more.

Thats very sweet of you. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	What did you get him? So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	They get him a house and warm food I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	Thats amazing. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I am glad you were there to help him. I would like to start making a difference today.	I would do the same No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Its extremely sad. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I think you can still make a difference. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Great idea!! Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I agree. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Exactly!!!. How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	I hope more people think like you and me I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. I little bit of know Save the children life.	But we can always try. i can walk but that is all can do.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I agree. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	What do you have in mind? I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	tell to family and friends is a first step On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	And share on social media could be the next step? Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.

It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I am glad you were there to help him.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello No thank you for the work that you do	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Nope, what do you recommend? Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Even small amounts will definitely help But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	What's Save the Children all about? It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies I love getting the word out there on this charity.	That would work best for me. Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	That way i know where my money is going. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Is there a minimum to donate? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening I know we can both feel good about that.	Hello I am not sure I am just very biased	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend? I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Even small amounts will definitely help But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	What's Save the Children all about? really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Do they help our children in the US as well?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. If only more people were more giving like you!	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	That would work best for me. I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	That way i know where my money is going. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Is there a minimum to donate? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. tell to family and friends is a first step	They know that any small amount can help. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	That's great! every other month or so, but not to them	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening tell to family and friends is a first step	Hello I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Nope, what do you recommend? i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Even small amounts will definitely help We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	What's Save the Children all about? That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Do they help our children in the US as well?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies The money would at least go to a good cause.	That would work best for me. Children should be our top priority all across the world.	That way i know where my money is going. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Is there a minimum to donate? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	They know that any small amount can help. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	That's great! Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Is there a website where i can donate? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I'm glad to hear it! Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.

Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	What's Save the Children all about? Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? How much money a year does save the children raise?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	That would work best for me. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	That way i know where my money is going. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Is there a minimum to donate? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	They know that any small amount can help. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	That's great! I little bit of know Save the children life.	Is there a website where i can donate? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	I'm glad to hear it! So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?

Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Nope, what do you recommend? Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?

I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Is there a minimum to donate? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	They know that any small amount can help. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	That's great! If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Is there a website where i can donate? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I'm glad to hear it!

Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. What do you do for work and do you like it?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	What is the easier way? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies they are good too, but this one I prefer	That would work best for me. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	That way i know where my money is going. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Is there a minimum to donate? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	They know that any small amount can help. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	That's great! I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Is there a website where i can donate? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I'm glad to hear it! Great, how much would you like to donate today?	Save the Children do have a website at  URL They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	What is the easier way? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Yeah, it does sound good. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	Of course it's your decision, in the end. The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	I am kind of curious about the details though. You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I think i will make a donation of $2 The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	That's wonderful! I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	It was great chatting with you. Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	And thanks for helping! I usually just try to go with half for these things.	That's wonderful! In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.

Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	Unfortunately I can't donate anything right now sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	ohh that is really sad to hear. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	You can donate as little as you want. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I will keep that in mind. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate. They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	That is very thoughtful of you. If only more people were more giving like you!	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Of course! Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.

20180825-043516_619_live	Hi, I hope you are well today!	I am how are you doing? Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Great! Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity! So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Same here! Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	Are you familiar with them? Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	No I am not. Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Can you tell me about it? Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	What can I do to help? How much do we have to share with them?	I'm so glad you asked! Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	Ok how much do you need? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	Isn't that amazing? I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Have an awesome day and thank you again!	What is the website for Save the Children?

What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	What can I do to help? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I'm so glad you asked! Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Ok how much do you need? What is your recommendation on how we can help	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Isn't that amazing? Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I can't work all day. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.

I'm so glad you asked! Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	Ok how much do you need? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Isn't that amazing? Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. We definitely need more people like you in the world.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I can't work all day. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.

Are you familiar with them? Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	No I am not. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Can you tell me about it? How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	What can I do to help? Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I'm so glad you asked! Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.

If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Isn't that amazing?

That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.

Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	I can't work all day. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I have problems too. I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.

20180825-043516_619_live	Hi, I hope you are well today! Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	I am how are you doing? So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Great! I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity! I hope more people think like you and me	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity. I would love to help in anyway I can.	Same here! How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children. I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Are you familiar with them?	No I am not. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Can you tell me about it? Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	What can I do to help? Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I'm so glad you asked! It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	Ok how much do you need? okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Isn't that amazing? So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I can't work all day. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. Thank you for your time, have a great day.	I have problems too. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.

I know right, It is a big thing to do.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Same here!

If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Isn't that amazing? There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.

However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. How much would you be willing to donate today?	I have problems too. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I have 10 cents I can give. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	That's awesome and generous!

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization? Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	I have a very rudimentary understanding. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I think it has to do with helping sick children. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries. Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	That is a great cause. No thank you for the work that you do	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Especially animal organizations. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically. No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own. I understand but these children have even less than us.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	that is true. I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	How do you feel about animal charities? Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	Small donations really do add up and make a difference. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities. I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Especially animal organizations. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically. I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own. It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	that is true. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss. You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	How do you feel about animal charities?

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello! I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Are you aware of Save the Children organization? I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I have a very rudimentary understanding. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I think it has to do with helping sick children. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries. Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	That is a great cause. No thank you for the work that you do	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Especially animal organizations. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically. How much do you like to donate to the charity?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true. every other month or so, but not to them	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	How do you feel about animal charities? Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities. Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	So you charity of choice is Save the Children? Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Or do you donate to other ones also? Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	My charity of choice is Save the Children. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	I strongly identify with their causes and goals. How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	Do you donate money only? Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Or do you also volunteer your time? Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same. I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents. I think i will make a donation of $2	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.

Especially animal organizations. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically. Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own. Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!

You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Small donations really do add up and make a difference. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	So you charity of choice is Save the Children? Are you apart of this organization or just support them?

If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same. I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	But I do agree with the points you made in support. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money? Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause. Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money. Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice? Have you ever donate for children in your area?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	They save miniture IG dogs. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	But children's charities are great too. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true? I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	That is great! I know we can both feel good about that.	Animal charities are pretty great too! I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Celebrities often get involved and donate time. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	It's really cool. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I think Disney World participates too. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved. Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	For sure. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit. Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them. I dealt with that more when I was working.	I definitely agree with all those points. Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not. How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.
20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities. URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children? Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Or do you donate to other ones also? If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	My charity of choice is Save the Children. cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	I strongly identify with their causes and goals. Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Do you donate money only? Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Or do you also volunteer your time? Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same. Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	I would be willing to donate 10 cents. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	But I do agree with the points you made in support. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money? If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause. I know we can both feel good about that.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money. tell to family and friends is a first step	I believe it would be a valuable experience. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	They save miniture IG dogs. I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	But children's charities are great too. I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true? I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	That is great! no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Animal charities are pretty great too! So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them. You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.

The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?

Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.

I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing? If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	There are ways to make a difference for sure. My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Yes that is a common way. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world. Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Have you presonally donated to them? I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Would you whole heartedly donate? i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	How do you know that they are effective? Can you tell me more about what they do?	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go? really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	Okay. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	That's good of you to donate. therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task? HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	Even a little can do a lot. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Sure I will donate 20 cents. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	thank you very much

Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person? Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Small changes lead to big results. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	;) and haha! Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Yes, I am. :) You would like to donate a dollar a day?	Good luck to you! No thank you for the work that you do	I hope you get lots of donations. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	They're a great charity I support. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I do the same for World Vision. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I sponsor 3 children. Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	That's amazing. I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. All of us should be in this world together.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. they are good too, but this one I prefer	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	How long have you been donating? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	For years. Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. How much would you like to donate to the organization?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I do the same for World Vision. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I sponsor 3 children. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	That's amazing. Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	How long have you been donating? okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	For years. URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?

How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I do the same for World Vision. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I sponsor 3 children. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	That's amazing. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	How long have you been donating? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	For years. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	That is good. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.

I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I do the same for World Vision. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I sponsor 3 children. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	That's amazing. Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	How long have you been donating? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	For years. You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	That is good. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I would love to help in anyway I can.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Absolutely. How much do you like to donate to the charity?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	You know what, you've encouraged me. What are your other plans for the day today?	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	You want to join me? Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.

Sure. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I would love to help. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I would love to make a donation today. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	That's amazing. How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	Should we give our whole 30 cents? My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!

We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.

Sure. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I would love to help. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I would love to make a donation today. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	That's amazing. You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	Should we give our whole 30 cents? How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Hassle free. It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Ok, sounds good. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I'll donate the whole amount. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. What are your other plans for the day today?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Great. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Thanks for sharing. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I'm going to blog about you later today. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It will encourage our friends. tell to family and friends is a first step	Very good. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	I glad we can help. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Every bit helps. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I am glad you were there to help him.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Absolutely. no and i regret that i've been so selfish	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	You know what, you've encouraged me. Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	You want to join me? You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	It won't be much but every penny counts. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Sure. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I would love to help. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I would love to make a donation today. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	That's amazing. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? I hope more people think like you and me	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Thank you for your time, have a great day.	Probably more. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? How much do we have to share with them?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free. Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Ok, sounds good. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I'll donate the whole amount. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. yes it would be a dollar from each of us	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Great. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Thanks for sharing. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	I'm going to blog about you later today. How much would you be willing to donate today?	It will encourage our friends. On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Very good. every other month or so, but not to them	I glad we can help.

Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Sure. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I would love to help. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	I would love to make a donation today. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	That's amazing. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Probably more. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What is your recommendation on how we can help	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	Hassle free. Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	Ok, sounds good. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I'll donate the whole amount. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Great. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Thanks for sharing. Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	It will encourage our friends. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Very good. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I glad we can help. ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Every bit helps. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	You've encouraged my heart today. You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Ditto to you. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Have a great day. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	God bless! I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Goodbye. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Have a wonderful day. One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	You. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Enjoy the rest of the day. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.

I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	Probably more. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? How much do we have to share with them?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Thanks for sharing. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.

It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I'll donate the whole amount. I think i will make a donation of $2	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Great. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I am glad you were there to help him.	Thanks for sharing. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	I'm going to blog about you later today.

How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	You've encouraged my heart today. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Ditto to you. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Have a great day. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	God bless! Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Goodbye. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Have a wonderful day.	You. ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	That makes sense. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.

Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Do they help our children in the US as well?	They do everything. On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Food is just one part of it. Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Interesting. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I was unaware. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Any child that needs help deserves it. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. That's very good since they do so much for children.	What is your recommendation on how we can help How much do we have to share with them?	Any donation will help. Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Even if it's small. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?

How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I believe you can do it it in the chat. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Ok that sounds easy enough. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ? Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today? i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Not bad.

My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Even if it's small. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	That makes sense. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.

Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	They do everything. That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	Food is just one part of it.

Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	That makes sense.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you! Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	How is your day going so far? Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I am doing well. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Have you heard of Save the Children? Are you aware of what save te children does?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. Save the Children do have a website at  URL	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. I am glad you were there to help him.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Oh there are quiet a few ways. I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	absolutely thank you so much!! cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. This is the only one that comes to mind	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	absolutely thank you so much!! Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Absolutely. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	I love getting the word out there on this charity. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Children should be a priority in the world. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	They are our future. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	They are our future exactly. they sound like a good charity to donate to	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	How long have you been supporting this charity? If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. You can decide how much you want to donate.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? What more can we do for the least of these?	I would like to start making a difference today. we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Thank you! It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	That makes my heart so happy. no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	It hurts my heart. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Every penny counts!! Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Well that sounds just great to me! Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I will spread the word! without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	absolutely thank you so much!! Would you like to help and donate to them?	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Absolutely. Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Children should be a priority in the world. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	They are our future. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	They are our future exactly. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	How long have you been supporting this charity? Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. A productive activity to fill your free time with.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.

That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Thank you! Are you going to donate anything at this time?	That makes my heart so happy. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	It hurts my heart. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Every penny counts!! I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Well that sounds just great to me! I little bit of know Save the children life.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! but it never reached to the people i heard so far	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I will spread the word! I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	They are our future exactly. It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	How long have you been supporting this charity? Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	I would like to start making a difference today. they sound like a good charity to donate to	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Thank you! Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	That makes my heart so happy. What more can we do for the least of these?	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	It hurts my heart. I am glad you were there to help him.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Every penny counts!! We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Well that sounds just great to me! OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! The money would at least go to a good cause.	I will spread the word! Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	i suppose I usually just try to go with half for these things.	My favorite charity is Save The Children. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Have you heard of them? Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. they are good too, but this one I prefer	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	i would not doubt that all. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	So no No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us. Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	This is your chance to do some good. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...

Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	My favorite charity is Save The Children. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Have you heard of them? do you know what save the children fund does?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them The money would at least go to a good cause.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	i would not doubt that all. every other month or so, but not to them	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	So no No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us. What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	This is your chance to do some good. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	i said I do this for a living. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	i suppose I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	My favorite charity is Save The Children. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Have you heard of them? Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	i would not doubt that all. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	So no I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I understand but these children have even less than us. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	This is your chance to do some good. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	i said I do this for a living. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	What I give away takes food from my mouth. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	You have plenty of rich people out there Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Everyone can help. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	All of us should be in this world together. I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Would you rather donate your time? Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	i cant do that either. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	i can walk but that is all can do. And share on social media could be the next step?	I cant stand very long I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	i suppose I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	My favorite charity is Save The Children. Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Have you heard of them? Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? maybe there are children who may die without this money	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	i would not doubt that all. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	So no No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	i said I do this for a living. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	You have plenty of rich people out there I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Everyone can help. If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	All of us should be in this world together. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Would you rather donate your time? Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	i cant do that either. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	i can walk but that is all can do. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I cant stand very long i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	take your penny then I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	are there any charities that you favor? Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	save the children but hurt me I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? Are you aware of what save te children does?	i suppose So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	My favorite charity is Save The Children. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Have you heard of them? Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	i would not doubt that all. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	So no I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I understand but these children have even less than us. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	i said I do this for a living. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	You have plenty of rich people out there To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Everyone can help. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	All of us should be in this world together. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? The money would at least go to a good cause.	Would you rather donate your time? Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	i cant do that either. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	i can walk but that is all can do. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I cant stand very long I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	take your penny then ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	are there any charities that you favor? Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	save the children but hurt me Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	take your penny then YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	are there any charities that you favor? Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	save the children but hurt me I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	i have my own low times. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	constant pain in my feet I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	hope things get better for you! How much would you like to donate to the organization?
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	i would not doubt that all. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	So no No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	This is your chance to do some good. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	i said I do this for a living. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	What I give away takes food from my mouth. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	You have plenty of rich people out there I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Everyone can help. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	All of us should be in this world together. I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. I am not sure I am just very biased	i can walk but that is all can do. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I cant stand very long I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	take your penny then I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	are there any charities that you favor? Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	save the children but hurt me Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	i have my own low times. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	constant pain in my feet Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	hope things get better for you! cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?

So no That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I understand but these children have even less than us. Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	This is your chance to do some good. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	i said I do this for a living. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.

I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. I am not sure I am just very biased	i can walk but that is all can do. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.

What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	save the children but hurt me I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.

It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	They are a fantastic charity. Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.

You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Its because I dont trust non profits What I give away takes food from my mouth.	That's understandable. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Thank you for your time today.

No thank you for the work that you do It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?

You would like to donate a dollar a day?	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky? So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full? Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	With no place to live? I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I think that is is awful and sad. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	What do we do about it?

Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I think that is is awful and sad. Children should be our top priority all across the world.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	That is amazing.	Tell me more.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I would like to help.	What would you consider an acceptable contribution?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Where do I sign up? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do. Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.

I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	These children die from hunger daily. What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Do you donate to this cause as well? I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	If so, how much do you give? i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I do  ! No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	I think you are a wonderful person. Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Thank you so much for telling me about this. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation . That's very good since they do so much for children.	I admire that ! I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.
