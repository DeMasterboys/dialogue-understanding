I am really glad that you donated.	What are your other plans for the day today?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.

20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today?	Hey I'm fine.	How are you doing? The money would at least go to a good cause.	I am doing really good. I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	So, what are you up to today? We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I can't decide which onne. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children. Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	How do you feel about this charity? Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	Do you know that charity's mission? Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I really like their mission. I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	I really feel badly for the kids. I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	Don't you? Would you like some information about the charity first?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They are based in CT. They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Could you donate anything to them? I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	yes I can.	I can donate 10 dollars. I think i will make a donation of $2	Wow! You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	that is so great. Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Thank you so much. Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes? Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	OH, yeah food please. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Gotta feed the hungry first If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Yes! I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	I think that is a great idea. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this? Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	no this is my first time. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	what do I do now? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	You do not have to do anything else. You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	I am really glad that you donated. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	What are your other plans for the day today? Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic. i can walk but that is all can do.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	What kind of camera do you have?	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?

There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	That is awesome! I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?

Of course, its a great organization to support Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Have you donated to a similar charity? What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Yes, a few times before thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!

I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	Save the Children is a great organization. And can help these poor children in such a big way.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	I have not heard of Save the Children before. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Sounds like they really help education wise. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	They do. This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	But they also assist in other ways. It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Thats awesome! If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	I like that they are transparent.

I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	I couldn't agree more. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	It sure does. therefore we should do our best to make that happen	ANything else I should know about this charity? How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise. I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	They do. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	But they also assist in other ways. Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. Save the Children do have a website at  URL	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Thats awesome! When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. And can help these poor children in such a big way.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I couldn't agree more. I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	It sure does. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	ANything else I should know about this charity? How much money a year does save the children raise?	It is a huge movement. I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

They do. they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	But they also assist in other ways. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Thats awesome! Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more. It will help these children in a big way.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	It sure does. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	ANything else I should know about this charity? Do they help our children in the US as well?	It is a huge movement. You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?

I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Literally every penny helps these children. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. I am kind of curious about the details though.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	You are AWESOME! I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I will donate 0.05 cents today. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Thank you :) Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome! I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. they sound like a good charity to donate to	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I couldn't agree more. Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	It sure does. I see no reason not to help this charity.	ANything else I should know about this charity? Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	It is a huge movement. Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	These kids really deserve it :) I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. I am kind of curious about the details though.	Literally every penny helps these children. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) I am kind of curious about the details though.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	You are AWESOME! One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	I will donate 0.05 cents today. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Thank you :) I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.

I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. they sound like a good charity to donate to	I couldn't agree more. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. A productive activity to fill your free time with.	It sure does. My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	ANything else I should know about this charity? How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?

Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.

You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.

Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I couldn't agree more. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	It sure does. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	ANything else I should know about this charity?

They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.

20180903-103939_512_live	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I guess I could throw them .10	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	It wouldn't hurt to give more.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	You know they're worse off than you, right?	Honestly < do not think so.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children? I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	0k Here is a .25 i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you? I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also… I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children.. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though. It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different? I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I\'m sure you could give $2 Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need? Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Then why not give some money to these kids too? While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	They have even less than your daughter has. maybe there are children who may die without this money	You can surely spare $2 Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2). I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area? Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	And a few other local charities specifically for children. I am not sure I am just very biased	Have you ever donated to children? Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Yes, I have. I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	Thats very sweet of you. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	What did you get him? Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program. A productive activity to fill your free time with.	They get him a house and warm food A productive activity to fill your free time with.	Thats amazing. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I am glad you were there to help him. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I would do the same It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Its extremely sad. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I think you can still make a difference. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?

Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Great idea!! That way i know where my money is going.	Thank for helping to the cause. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Exactly!!!. Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	I hope more people think like you and me Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. No thank you for the work that you do	But we can always try. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I agree. Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	What do you have in mind? The money would at least go to a good cause.	tell to family and friends is a first step Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	And share on social media could be the next step? I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	What did you get him? So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program. I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	They get him a house and warm food I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	Thats amazing. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I am glad you were there to help him. WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I would do the same Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	Its extremely sad. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I think you can still make a difference. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Great idea!! My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	Thank for helping to the cause. Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world. It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Everyone should be responsible of this issue They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I agree. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Exactly!!!. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I hope more people think like you and me Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	But we can always try. every other month or so, but not to them	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I agree. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	What do you have in mind? You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	tell to family and friends is a first step Great, how much would you like to donate today?	And share on social media could be the next step? I usually just try to go with half for these things.

But we can always try. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I agree. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	What do you have in mind? Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	tell to family and friends is a first step Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening If only more people were more giving like you!	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	Nope, what do you recommend? Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Even small amounts will definitely help Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	What's Save the Children all about? Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	That would work best for me. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	That way i know where my money is going. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Is there a minimum to donate? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. How much do you like to donate to the charity?	They know that any small amount can help. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Hello Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Even small amounts will definitely help But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	What's Save the Children all about? No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Do they help our children in the US as well?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.

Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Nope, what do you recommend? Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Even small amounts will definitely help I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? How much money a year does save the children raise?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies The money would at least go to a good cause.	That would work best for me. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	That way i know where my money is going. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	Is there a minimum to donate? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	They know that any small amount can help. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	That's great! Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Is there a website where i can donate? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I'm glad to hear it! Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	What is the easier way? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.

Hello I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Nope, what do you recommend? And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Even small amounts will definitely help But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	What's Save the Children all about? Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	That would work best for me. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	That way i know where my money is going. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Is there a minimum to donate? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. We definitely need more people like you in the world.	They know that any small amount can help. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	That's great! I dealt with that more when I was working.	Is there a website where i can donate? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I'm glad to hear it! Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	What is the easier way? That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.

I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.

Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	That would work best for me. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	That way i know where my money is going. It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Is there a minimum to donate? Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	They know that any small amount can help. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I'm glad to hear it! I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	What is the easier way? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	That's interesting and sounds good, right? I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Yeah, it does sound good. So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	Of course it's your decision, in the end. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I am kind of curious about the details though. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	I think i will make a donation of $2 no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	That's wonderful! The money would at least go to a good cause.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	It was great chatting with you. I am not sure I am just very biased	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Nope, what do you recommend? Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Even small amounts will definitely help Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	What's Save the Children all about? Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate There is a lot of info about the organization there.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	That would work best for me. Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	That way i know where my money is going. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Is there a minimum to donate? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	They know that any small amount can help. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	That's great! Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it! I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Save the Children do have a website at  URL However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	What is the easier way? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Yeah, it does sound good. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I am kind of curious about the details though. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I think i will make a donation of $2 i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	That's wonderful! And share on social media could be the next step?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	It was great chatting with you. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	And thanks for helping! No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	What's Save the Children all about? Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too Thank you so much for telling me about this.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	That would work best for me. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	That way i know where my money is going. I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Is there a minimum to donate? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	They know that any small amount can help. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	That's great! Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Is there a website where i can donate? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I'm glad to hear it! How much would you be willing to donate today?	Save the Children do have a website at  URL Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Yeah, it does sound good. I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Of course it's your decision, in the end. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I am kind of curious about the details though. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I think i will make a donation of $2 I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	That's wonderful! OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	It was great chatting with you. Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	And thanks for helping! No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	That's wonderful! So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?

No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.

Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. What do you do for work and do you like it?	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	That would work best for me. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	That way i know where my money is going. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Is there a minimum to donate? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	They know that any small amount can help. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	That's great! WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Is there a website where i can donate? So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I'm glad to hear it! I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	Save the Children do have a website at  URL they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	What is the easier way? So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?

Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	It was great chatting with you. I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	And thanks for helping!

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	That's great! I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Is there a website where i can donate? Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I'm glad to hear it! I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	What is the easier way? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Yeah, it does sound good. With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I am kind of curious about the details though. If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? If only more people were more giving like you!	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	I think i will make a donation of $2 I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	That's wonderful! It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping! Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	That's wonderful! You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. This is the only one that comes to mind	It was great chatting with you. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	And thanks for helping! On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity

You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	What is the easier way? Do you know where I can go to donate?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	That's interesting and sounds good, right? Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Yeah, it does sound good. It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	I am kind of curious about the details though. yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	I think i will make a donation of $2 The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	That's wonderful! I am not sure I am just very biased	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	It was great chatting with you. I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I would love to help in anyway I can.

I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	ok. than how is you family OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor. It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too. you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	oh ok. i love children's very much.

You will? but it never reached to the people i heard so far	That's great. It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I know we can both feel good about that.

Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now. Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	LOL Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	why you laugh. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	i am also laughing .didn't tell anything i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Just happy to be through with working. I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	What do you do for work and do you like it? Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	i am not working.

I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity! What do you do for work and do you like it?	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Same here! We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children. Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Are you familiar with them? I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	No I am not. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Can you tell me about it? Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	What can I do to help? Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I'm so glad you asked! I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. How much do you like to donate to the charity?	Ok how much do you need? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Isn't that amazing? I understand but these children have even less than us.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	No I am not. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Can you tell me about it? really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries. I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	What can I do to help? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I'm so glad you asked! Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Ok how much do you need? What is your recommendation on how we can help	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Isn't that amazing? It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I can't work all day. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.

It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. maybe there are children who may die without this money	What can I do to help? What is your recommendation on how we can help	I'm so glad you asked! Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	Ok how much do you need? How much do we have to share with them?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Isn't that amazing? Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I can't work all day. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	I have problems too. I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

I dealt with that more when I was working.	Great! Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity! Thank you for your time, have a great day.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Same here!

They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	What can I do to help? How much do we have to share with them?	I'm so glad you asked! In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	Ok how much do you need? Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Isn't that amazing? In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I can't work all day. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I have problems too. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I have 10 cents I can give. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.

Are you familiar with them? Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	No I am not. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Can you tell me about it? Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. I understand but these children have even less than us.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked! Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now. Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	Ok how much do you need? How much do we have to share with them?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day! In comparison, these children need more help than you or I.

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I can't work all day. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	I have problems too. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I have 10 cents I can give.

Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	That is a great cause. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Especially animal organizations. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically. With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own. The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	that is true. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss. Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	How do you feel about animal charities? What is your recommendation on how we can help	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Small donations really do add up and make a difference. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities. Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	So you charity of choice is Save the Children? from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Or do you donate to other ones also? If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.

Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	I believe it would be a valuable experience. If only more people were more giving like you!	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice? Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	They save miniture IG dogs. I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	But children's charities are great too. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true? Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	That is great! I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Animal charities are pretty great too! Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them. I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	Celebrities often get involved and donate time. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	It's really cool. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I think Disney World participates too. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	I definitely agree with all those points. You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too. I have not heard of Save the Children before.

Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's a great organization!	Is it reputable?	Certainly!	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization? How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Wonderful! That's very good since they do so much for children.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Sounds good. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer? If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	That's interesting. That way i know where my money is going.	I might want to volunteer too. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	It's a very rewarding experience. I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	A productive activity to fill your free time with. I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	:) That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own. I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Certainly. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	Thanks for telling me about it. Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	You are welcome! What do you do for work and do you like it?	Thank you for your kind donation. Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	It's not much, but I don't have much money. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	;) and haha! Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Yes, I am. :) I hope more people think like you and me	Good luck to you! Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	I hope you get lots of donations. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.

How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	It's not much, but I don't have much money. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?

Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support. I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I sponsor 3 children. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	That's amazing. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	How long have you been donating? Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	For years. What do you do for work and do you like it?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	That is good. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.

We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	That is good. I am not sure I am just very biased	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.

We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I do the same for World Vision. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing. That's very good since they do so much for children.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	How long have you been donating? How much do we have to share with them?	For years. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Save the Children do have a website at  URL	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	That is good. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	They're a great charity I support. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I do the same for World Vision. My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I sponsor 3 children. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	That's amazing. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	How long have you been donating? What is your recommendation on how we can help	For years. I know we can both feel good about that.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	That is good. Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I would love to help in anyway I can.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Absolutely. What do you do for work and do you like it?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	You know what, you've encouraged me. What do you do for work and do you like it?	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	You want to join me? No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?

I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I sponsor 3 children. I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	That's amazing. Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. All of us should be in this world together.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!

Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	That is good. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Absolutely. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. yes it would be a dollar from each of us	You know what, you've encouraged me.

It won't be much but every penny counts. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?

That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.

It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.

I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. You could find that out here at this website.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	That is good. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Absolutely. You would like to donate a dollar a day?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	You know what, you've encouraged me. Would you like to help and donate to them?	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	You want to join me? Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Sure. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I would love to help. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I would love to make a donation today. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	That's amazing. What more can we do for the least of these?	Should we give our whole 30 cents? It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Are you going to donate anything at this time?	Probably more. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? How much do we have to share with them?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. maybe there are children who may die without this money	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.

Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	That is good. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Absolutely. That's very good since they do so much for children.

I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	That's amazing. no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	Probably more. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I do the same for World Vision.

Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	How long have you been donating? What is your recommendation on how we can help	For years. No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. How much would you be willing to donate today?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	That is good. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Absolutely.

I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.

HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	That is good. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Absolutely. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. How much do you like to donate to the charity?	You know what, you've encouraged me. I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	You want to join me? Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	It won't be much but every penny counts. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Sure.	I would love to help. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I would love to make a donation today. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	That's amazing. So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Probably more. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Hassle free. What are your other plans for the day today?	Ok, sounds good. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I'll donate the whole amount. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. You would like to donate a dollar a day?	Great. i can walk but that is all can do.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Thanks for sharing. every other month or so, but not to them	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Are you going to donate anything at this time?	I'm going to blog about you later today. How much do you like to donate to the charity?	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.

The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	I'm going to blog about you later today. I know right, It is a big thing to do.	It will encourage our friends. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	That is good. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. they sound like a good charity to donate to	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Absolutely. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	You know what, you've encouraged me. I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	You want to join me? I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	It won't be much but every penny counts. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Sure. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	I would love to help. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	Should we give our whole 30 cents? I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	Probably more. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	Hassle free. How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Ok, sounds good. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I'll donate the whole amount. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Great. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Thanks for sharing. No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	It will encourage our friends. I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Very good. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	That is good. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Absolutely. Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?

Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	You want to join me? You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	It won't be much but every penny counts. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Sure. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I would love to help. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I would love to make a donation today. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	That's amazing. Thank you for your time, have a great day.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? It will help these children in a big way.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	Hassle free. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Ok, sounds good. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I'll donate the whole amount. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Great. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Thanks for sharing. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	I'm going to blog about you later today. I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	It will encourage our friends. Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Very good. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I glad we can help. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Every bit helps. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	You've encouraged my heart today. Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Absolutely. How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

Probably more. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. You can decide how much you want to donate.	Hassle free. How much would you be willing to donate today?	Ok, sounds good. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I'll donate the whole amount. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	Great. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

How much would you be willing to donate today?	I'm going to blog about you later today. Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	It will encourage our friends.

Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What is your recommendation on how we can help	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Hassle free.

I'm so glad I got partnered with you. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Great. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Thanks for sharing. You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I'm going to blog about you later today.

Goodbye. Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	Have a wonderful day. Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

It won't be much but every penny counts. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Sure. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I would love to help. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I would love to make a donation today. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	That's amazing. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Probably more. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Hassle free. Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	Ok, sounds good. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I'll donate the whole amount. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Great, how much would you like to donate today?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thanks for sharing. Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. How much would you like to donate to the organization?	I'm going to blog about you later today.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me. Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	You want to join me? Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	It won't be much but every penny counts. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Sure. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I would love to help. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I would love to make a donation today. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	That's amazing. That's very good since they do so much for children.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Probably more. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Hassle free. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Ok, sounds good. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I'll donate the whole amount. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Great. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Great, how much would you like to donate today?	It will encourage our friends. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Very good. I am not sure I am just very biased	I glad we can help. ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Every bit helps. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Are you going to donate anything at this time?	You've encouraged my heart today. Would you like to help and donate to them?	Ditto to you. And share on social media could be the next step?	Have a great day. i can walk but that is all can do.	God bless! I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Goodbye. Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	Have a wonderful day. One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	You. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Enjoy the rest of the day. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.

That's amazing. no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Thank you for your time, have a great day.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.

What is your recommendation on how we can help	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Hassle free. It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Ok, sounds good. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I'll donate the whole amount. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. You would like to donate a dollar a day?

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	Hassle free. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Ok, sounds good. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I'll donate the whole amount. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. What are your other plans for the day today?	Great. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thanks for sharing. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	I'm going to blog about you later today. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	It will encourage our friends. Are you going to donate anything at this time?	Very good. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I glad we can help. No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Every bit helps. I dealt with that more when I was working.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	You've encouraged my heart today. Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	Ditto to you.	Have a great day. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	God bless! I little bit of know Save the children life.	Goodbye. It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Have a wonderful day. What do you do for work and do you like it?	You. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Enjoy the rest of the day. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.

That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	Hassle free. Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	Ok, sounds good. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I'll donate the whole amount. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	Great. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. they sound like a good charity to donate to	Thanks for sharing. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	I'm going to blog about you later today. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	It will encourage our friends. I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	Very good. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I glad we can help. The money would at least go to a good cause.	Every bit helps. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. How much do you like to donate to the charity?	You've encouraged my heart today. That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	Ditto to you. I am not sure I am just very biased	Have a great day.	God bless! Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Goodbye. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Have a wonderful day. Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	You. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Enjoy the rest of the day. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US

So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	I'm going to blog about you later today.

No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	I glad we can help. No thank you for the work that you do	Every bit helps.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad. I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	They do everything. They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Food is just one part of it. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Interesting. I dealt with that more when I was working.	I was unaware. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Any child that needs help deserves it. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	What is your recommendation on how we can help okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Any donation will help. What are your other plans for the day today?	Even if it's small. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	That makes sense. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Hello, how are you today? Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Not bad. Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	They do everything. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Food is just one part of it. I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Interesting. Wow, they really help people all around the world.	I was unaware. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Any child that needs help deserves it. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	What is your recommendation on how we can help How much do we have to share with them?	Any donation will help. What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	Even if it's small. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	That makes sense. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	Ok that is good to know. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! What do you do for work and do you like it?	Hello, how are you today? i can walk but that is all can do.	Not bad. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Are you aware of what save te children does?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity How much money a year does save the children raise?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	They do everything. The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	Food is just one part of it. they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	Interesting. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I was unaware. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Any child that needs help deserves it. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	What is your recommendation on how we can help What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Any donation will help. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Even if it's small. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	That makes sense. Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	In this particular format, we can only accept money. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	Ok that is good to know. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	Hello, how are you today? No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Not bad. I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything. They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Food is just one part of it. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Interesting. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I was unaware. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Any child that needs help deserves it. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	What is your recommendation on how we can help okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Any donation will help. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	Even if it's small. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	That makes sense. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Do you know where I can go to donate?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Ok that is good to know. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	How would this donation be made? So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I believe you can do it it in the chat. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?

Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They do everything. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.

I believe you can do it it in the chat. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Ok that sounds easy enough. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?

What is your recommendation on how we can help Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Any donation will help. no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Even if it's small. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	That makes sense. I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Ok that is good to know. Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	How would this donation be made? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I believe you can do it it in the chat. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ? I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today? Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far? thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I am doing well. With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Have you heard of Save the Children? hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Children should be our top priority all across the world. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	absolutely thank you so much!! Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Absolutely. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Have you heard of Save the Children? Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	absolutely thank you so much!! It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Absolutely. Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Children should be a priority in the world. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	They are our future. I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	They are our future exactly. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.

I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Children should be a priority in the world. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	They are our future. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	They are our future exactly. They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity? So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. A productive activity to fill your free time with.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	I would like to start making a difference today. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Thank you! Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	That makes my heart so happy. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	It hurts my heart. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Every penny counts!! Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Well that sounds just great to me! I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	absolutely thank you so much!!

How much would you be willing to donate today?	I love getting the word out there on this charity. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Children should be a priority in the world. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	They are our future. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	They are our future exactly. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.

Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	I would like to start making a difference today. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Thank you! Then why not give some money to these kids too?	That makes my heart so happy. On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	It hurts my heart. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Every penny counts!! But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Well that sounds just great to me! The money would at least go to a good cause.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	I would like to start making a difference today. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Thank you! With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	That makes my heart so happy. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.

Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.

Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Well that sounds just great to me! Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	They are our future. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	They are our future exactly. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	How long have you been supporting this charity? Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	I would like to start making a difference today. It's not much, but I don't have much money.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Thank you! Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	That makes my heart so happy. I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	It hurts my heart. I am glad you were there to help him.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Every penny counts!! Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I will spread the word! Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.

But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Well that sounds just great to me! Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children. My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Have you heard of them? do you know what save the children fund does?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	i would not doubt that all. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	So no No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	This is your chance to do some good. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	i said I do this for a living. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	i suppose Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	My favorite charity is Save The Children. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Have you heard of them? I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	i would not doubt that all. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	So no That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I understand but these children have even less than us. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	This is your chance to do some good. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	i said I do this for a living. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	You have plenty of rich people out there I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Everyone can help. This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	All of us should be in this world together. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	i would not doubt that all. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.

My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	What I give away takes food from my mouth. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	You have plenty of rich people out there My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Everyone can help. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	All of us should be in this world together. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Would you rather donate your time? can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	i cant do that either. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	i can walk but that is all can do.

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	i would not doubt that all. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us. Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	This is your chance to do some good. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	i said I do this for a living. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	You have plenty of rich people out there I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Everyone can help. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	All of us should be in this world together. Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Would you rather donate your time? Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	i cant do that either. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	i can walk but that is all can do. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I cant stand very long You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. maybe there are children who may die without this money	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. maybe there are children who may die without this money	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	take your penny then well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	are there any charities that you favor? can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	i suppose No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	My favorite charity is Save The Children. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Have you heard of them? Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them I little bit of know Save the children life.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	i would not doubt that all. I dealt with that more when I was working.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	So no I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I understand but these children have even less than us. It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	This is your chance to do some good. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	You have plenty of rich people out there yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Everyone can help. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	All of us should be in this world together. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Would you rather donate your time? Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	i cant do that either. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	i can walk but that is all can do. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I cant stand very long I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	take your penny then Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	are there any charities that you favor? Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	save the children but hurt me Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	i have my own low times. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	constant pain in my feet I wish I could give more, but I am broke	hope things get better for you!

Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	i cant do that either. Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.

I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Would you rather donate your time? What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	i cant do that either. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?

I'm very glad to hear that. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky? I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full? Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	With no place to live? Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	I think that is is awful and sad. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	What do we do about it? Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Have you heard about Save the Children? Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Other than it mentioned today of course. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	nope I have never heard of it If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.

The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.
