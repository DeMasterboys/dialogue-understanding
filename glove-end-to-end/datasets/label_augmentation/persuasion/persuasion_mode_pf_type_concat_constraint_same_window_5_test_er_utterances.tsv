I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I can't decide which onne.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	How do you feel about this charity?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Do you know that charity's mission?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I really like their mission.	I really feel badly for the kids.	Don't you? Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	They are based in CT. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Could you donate anything to them? tell to family and friends is a first step	yes I can. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I can donate 10 dollars. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	no this is my first time.	what do I do now?	You do not have to do anything else.	I am really glad that you donated.	What are your other plans for the day today?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	What kind of camera do you have?	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?

Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	They are based in CT. Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Could you donate anything to them? Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	yes I can. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....

Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered? Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	They are based in CT. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Could you donate anything to them?	yes I can. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....

I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	That is awesome! Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with? It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I am so grateful for your donation.	It means alot to this rganization.	Of course, its a great organization to support	Have you donated to a similar charity?

20180826-180009_407_live	Hi!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your donation can address such problems.	Oh wow, shocking news.	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Thats awesome!	Are you apart of this organization or just support them? Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity? I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	That is awesome!	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with? Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I am so grateful for your donation. Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	It means alot to this rganization. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Of course, its a great organization to support	Have you donated to a similar charity?	Yes, a few times before	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Thank you, you too!

This is the only one that comes to mind	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	That is awesome! Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I am so grateful for your donation. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	It means alot to this rganization. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Of course, its a great organization to support they sound like a good charity to donate to	Have you donated to a similar charity?	Yes, a few times before	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Thank you, you too!

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	That is awesome! Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with? How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas they sound like a good charity to donate to	I am so grateful for your donation.

Of course, its a great organization to support Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Have you donated to a similar charity? What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Yes, a few times before So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before? from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Yes, I absolutely have. Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	Save the Children is a great organization. Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello! Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before? from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization. Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Sounds like they really help education wise. I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?

In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :) If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Literally every penny helps these children. I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Do you know where I can go to donate?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?

I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.

Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.

They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	You are AWESOME! I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? I know right, It is a big thing to do.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Thank you :) So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?

I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Then why not give some money to these kids too? Would you like to help and donate to them?	They have even less than your daughter has.	You can surely spare $2 Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.

I guess I could throw them .10	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	It wouldn't hurt to give more.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	You know they're worse off than you, right?	Honestly < do not think so.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	0k Here is a .25	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.

Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Then why not give some money to these kids too? Great, how much would you like to donate today?	They have even less than your daughter has. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	You can surely spare $2	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.

I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I would do the same That way i know where my money is going.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Its extremely sad. I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff. Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee. I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Nope, what do you recommend? ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening No but I can tell you about the charity!	Hello I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend? I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Even small amounts will definitely help I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?

I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!

You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	Of course it's your decision, in the end. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).

I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	I think i will make a donation of $2 I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	That's wonderful! No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.

What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?

No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Are you familiar with them?	No I am not.	Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I can't work all day. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I have 10 cents I can give. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Have an awesome day and thank you again!	What is the website for Save the Children?

I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. It will help these children in a big way.	I have problems too. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. The money would at least go to a good cause.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	I have 10 cents I can give. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	That's awesome and generous! I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization? Are you aware of what save te children does?	I have a very rudimentary understanding. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I think it has to do with helping sick children. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization. They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	It's a great organization!	Is it reputable? How much do we have to share with them?	Certainly! Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL You could find that out here at this website.	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	Wonderful!	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Sounds good.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Thanks for telling me about it.	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to you!	I hope you get lots of donations.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	They're a great charity I support. Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I do the same for World Vision. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.

Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Absolutely. yes it would be a dollar from each of us	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	You know what, you've encouraged me. Are you going to donate anything at this time?	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me? It will help these children in a big way.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Sure. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.

You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Sure.

What is your recommendation on how we can help	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free. Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	Ok, sounds good. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I'll donate the whole amount. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Probably more. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. You can decide how much you want to donate.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good. I dealt with that more when I was working.	I'll donate the whole amount. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. I hope more people think like you and me	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Hassle free. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Ok, sounds good. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I'll donate the whole amount. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Great. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Thanks for sharing. Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends. Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	Very good. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	I glad we can help. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Every bit helps. The money would at least go to a good cause.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Have a great day. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	God bless! i will like to know about the opportunity first	Goodbye. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Have a great day. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	God bless! Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Goodbye.

Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense. No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Do you know where I can go to donate?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help. Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Even if it's small. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	That makes sense. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	Ok that is good to know. i will like to know about the opportunity first	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?

That makes sense. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	How would this donation be made?

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Oh there are quiet a few ways. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	absolutely thank you so much!! I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	It hurts my heart. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me! Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! every other month or so, but not to them	I will spread the word! we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	So no No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us. That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	This is your chance to do some good. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	You have plenty of rich people out there I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Everyone can help. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause. That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Its because I dont trust non profits However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	That's understandable. How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	Thank you for your time today.	No thank you for the work that you do No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children? So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	I am not sure I am just very biased No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.
