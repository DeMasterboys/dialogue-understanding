I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	What was life like for you as a kid?	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.

20180825-070900_49_live	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Do you know that charity's mission?	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Could you donate anything to them?	yes I can.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.

You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).

I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	that is so great.	Thank you so much.

I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered?	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.

I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I can't decide which onne.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	How do you feel about this charity?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Do you know that charity's mission?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	yes I can.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	I would like to start making a difference today.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.

20180826-182047_49_live	Hi, how are you?	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	that sounds meaningful.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	How much would you be willing to donate today?	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?

20180826-182047_49_live	Hi, how are you?	Great!	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	How involved are you in the organization?	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I am glad you were there to help him.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	The children will appreciate it.	Do you donate to charities often?	I do.	I focus on kids and animals.	Make a wish is really cool.	Lots of celebrities get involved.	John Cena has granted 400 wishes!	Wow!	John Cena is amazing.

20180826-182047_49_live	Hi, how are you?	Great!	I have been research the Make-A-Wish foundation.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	How much do we have to share with them?	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Do you donate to charities often?	I do.	I focus on kids and animals.	Make a wish is really cool.	Lots of celebrities get involved.	John Cena has granted 400 wishes!	Wow!	John Cena is amazing.	You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.

Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	tell to family and friends is a first step	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I will.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.

Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I will do $10 to both.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.

With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I am so grateful for your donation.	It means alot to this rganization.	Of course, its a great organization to support	Have you donated to a similar charity?	Yes, a few times before	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Thank you, you too!
20180826-180009_407_live	Hi!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	Thats awesome!	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	It means alot to this rganization.	Of course, its a great organization to support	Have you donated to a similar charity?	Yes, a few times before	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Thank you, you too!

Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	What was life like for you as a kid?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Of course, its a great organization to support	Have you donated to a similar charity?	Yes, a few times before	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Thank you, you too!

Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	All of us should be in this world together.	What more can we do for the least of these?	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	Thank you, you too!

Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.

Thats awesome!	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	All of us should be in this world together.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	And share on social media could be the next step?	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Of course, its a great organization to support	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?

I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Yes, a few times before	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.

Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!

What is your recommendation on how we can help	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.

Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.

WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	And share on social media could be the next step?

They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I've been a donor and advocate for years.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I'd love to visit one of their facilities.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.

Can you tell me more about what they do?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?

That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	I would definitely like to make a donation!	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I understand but these children have even less than us.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	I'll gladly give all of my payment.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)
20180903-103939_512_live	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I dealt with that more when I was working.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	0k Here is a .25	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	They have even less than your daughter has.	You can surely spare $2	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.

20180903-103939_512_live	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I hope more people think like you and me	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Are you aware of what save te children does?	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Honestly < do not think so.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?

20180903-103939_512_live	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	No thank you for the work that you do	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.

We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.

Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	How much do we have to share with them?	You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I dealt with that more when I was working.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	But we can always try.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?

Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I agree.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.

I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	And share on social media could be the next step?
20180826-180300_663_live	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Hello	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

20180826-180300_663_live	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	Nope, what do you recommend?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.

You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.

One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.

Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.

Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	ok. than how is you family	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	where are you	I'm in Arizona where it is very HOT!	Where are you?	VANCOUVER.	WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB	Van couver in the US?	Is that in Washington state?	I don't work cause I already retired.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.

Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	oh ok. i love children's very much.

They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.

I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?

I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.

They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.

Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Would you like some information about the charity first?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	where are you	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.

As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	VANCOUVER.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	i am not working.	seeking job	I hope you find something soon.

Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	What is the website for Save the Children?	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.

Is this organization Christian or religious based?	It is in terms of values.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.

I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Where is this organization based?	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?

But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.

How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?

No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.

20180825-055427_625_live	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	That's very good since they do so much for children.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	every other month or so, but not to them	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	I dealt with that more when I was working.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	How long have you been donating?	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	That is good.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?

I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	they are good too, but this one I prefer	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Do they help our children in the US as well?	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Probably more.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Ok, sounds good.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I am glad you were there to help him.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	I'll donate the whole amount.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	How much do we have to share with them?	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.

That's amazing.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	every other month or so, but not to them	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	Great.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	All of us should be in this world together.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Thanks for sharing.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Very good.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

What is your recommendation on how we can help	Do they help our children in the US as well?	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Every bit helps.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	Ditto to you.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	How much do we have to share with them?

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I see no reason not to help this charity.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Have a great day.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.

Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	God bless!	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?

What is your recommendation on how we can help	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	You.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?

That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?

Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180808-081317_142_live	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Hello, how are you today?	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	I would like to start making a difference today.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.

20180808-081317_142_live	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

20180808-081317_142_live	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	i can walk but that is all can do.	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Interesting.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?

They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	I was unaware.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	they are good too, but this one I prefer	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.

I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Do you know where I can go to donate?	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Any child that needs help deserves it.	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?

Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.

A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	What is your recommendation on how we can help	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.

Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	That makes sense.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	What was life like for you as a kid?	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.

That way i know where my money is going.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I see no reason not to help this charity.

Sounds like they accomplish great things.	Are you thinking of a one time donation?	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	What are your thoughts?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	I think i will make a donation of $2	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	Well, don't feel bad.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	we have a moral responsibility to help	Right, nice chatting with you.	I'm proud of us.	I'm proud too.nice working with you.	I'm proud too.	nice working with you.

I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	We will donate today.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.

Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I propose we stick with our half plan.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.

Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	What do you think?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I understand but these children have even less than us.

Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.

I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?

We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I understand but these children have even less than us.

I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	It hurts my heart.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	yes! i said that's a fair point.	save the children is a good choice.
20180723-122005_335_live	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	I used to donate to them.	Do you like that charity?	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	what other organizations would you consider?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I see no reason not to help this charity.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one

I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.

Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	why is that?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	What I give away takes food from my mouth.

The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	that's a fair point	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.

I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	No but I can tell you about the charity!	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?

I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	save the children is a good choice.
20180826-175345_318_live	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	Yeah, what do you think about St Jude's?	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	How much money a year does save the children raise?	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	The usual cost is about $36 per child.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	That's actually quite reasonable!	I doesn't cost much.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Sounds like a blessed organization.	Yes it does.	Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	I definitely.	I recognize it too.	They do lots of TV adverts.	I believe its a Christian organization.	Yes.	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	It's on my to-do list though.

I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.
20180826-175345_318_live	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	That's wonderful!	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	That's actually quite reasonable!	I doesn't cost much.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.

The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.

20180826-175345_318_live	Hi!	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.

Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	Have you ever sponsored a child?

In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.

What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.

Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Yes i will.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?

Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.

No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	This is the only one that comes to mind	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.

Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.

We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Its because I dont trust non profits	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

I feel that it would be easy to donate.	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	I am not sure I am just very biased
20180719-175233_833_live	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Hey how's it going?	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	How much do we have to share with them?	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	Yes I have.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Yeah?	I would think so?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	But I"m always willing to help!	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Every little thing does make a difference.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I've seen videos that were so heartbreaking	Yea.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Oh really?	Nice!	What can we do to help?	Would you like to help by donating?	Sure, what amount is a smaller pledge?	Even a couple of cents.	Whatever you can afford.	Yeah, I can do that.	A dollar?
20180719-175233_833_live	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	So children's charity then...	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I dealt with that more when I was working.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Yeah?	I would think so?

I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	No, not currently.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	Can you tell me more about what they do?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Yeah?	I would think so?

Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I would think so?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	But I"m always willing to help!	We definitely need more people like you in the world.

It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I hope more people think like you and me	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.

Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	Do you donate to this cause as well?	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.

I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	That's very good since they do so much for children.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	If so, how much do you give?	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You've been great.

The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I think you are a wonderful person.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	maybe there are children who may die without this money	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.

Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?

Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	You could find that out here at this website.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Do you know where I can go to donate?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?

I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	I've heard of them.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	No thank you for the work that you do	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	Generous?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.

I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	I've heard of them.	How much do we have to share with them?	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	First, is your reward contingent on my donating?	Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.

What do I need to know about them?	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.

Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	i can walk but that is all can do.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?

Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Generous?	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?

And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.

HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.
