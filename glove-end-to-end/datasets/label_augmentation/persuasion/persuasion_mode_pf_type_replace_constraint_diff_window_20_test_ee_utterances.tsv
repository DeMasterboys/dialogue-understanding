They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.

I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?

Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	no this is my first time.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?

I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I see no reason not to help this charity.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?

Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I understand but these children have even less than us.	Yes, it really is.

Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I think i will make a donation of $2	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.

It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.

20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today?	Hey I'm fine.	How are you doing?	I am doing really good.	So, what are you up to today?	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I can't decide which onne.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	How do you feel about this charity?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Do you know that charity's mission?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I really like their mission.	I really feel badly for the kids.	Don't you?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered?	They are based in CT.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Could you donate anything to them?	yes I can.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	That's very good since they do so much for children.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	How much do we have to share with them?	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?

Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?

I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.

Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Have you ever donate for children in your area?

You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	Last year we raised 2.5 million dollars.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Absolutely.	I will donate $10 to Make a Wish.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	yes i am.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Thank you very much.	People like you make the world better.

20180826-182047_49_live	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Absolutely.	I will donate $10 to Make a Wish.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	yes i am.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Thank you very much.	People like you make the world better.	Have a wonderful night.	i hope the same for you also!

It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.

I know right, It is a big thing to do.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?

20180826-182047_49_live	Hi, how are you?	Great!	I have been research the Make-A-Wish foundation.	Are you familiar with it?	That's great!	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	What more can we do for the least of these?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I focus on kids and animals.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I little bit of know Save the children life.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	yes i am.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Thank you very much.	People like you make the world better.	Have a wonderful night.	i hope the same for you also!
20180826-182047_49_live	Hi, how are you?	Great!	I have been research the Make-A-Wish foundation.	Are you familiar with it?	That's great!	Yes, I am familiar with them.	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	Make a wish is really cool.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	yes i am.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Thank you very much.	People like you make the world better.	Have a wonderful night.	i hope the same for you also!

If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.

You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	Are you aware of what save te children does?	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?

Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.

Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money

So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Thats awesome!	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I am not sure I am just very biased	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!

In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	All of us should be in this world together.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I understand but these children have even less than us.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	I little bit of know Save the children life.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Are you aware of what save te children does?	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me

I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	That way i know where my money is going.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	Do you know where I can go to donate?	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.
20180826-180009_407_live	Hi!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	You could find that out here at this website.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	What was life like for you as a kid?	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?

Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.

Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.

What is your recommendation on how we can help	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!

Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.
20180826-062736_188_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you all	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	I would like to start making a difference today.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I see no reason not to help this charity.

20180826-062736_188_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you all	Hello how are	sorry it cut me off...	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?
20180826-062736_188_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you all	Hello how are	sorry it cut me off...	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	Yes pleas do	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	That way i know where my money is going.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity
20180826-062736_188_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you all	Hello how are	sorry it cut me off...	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	Yes pleas do	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	Sounds like a good charity.	What countries do they provide service to?	mainly children in developing countries.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	every other month or so, but not to them	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	I dealt with that more when I was working.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	maybe there are children who may die without this money	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Yes I would

I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.

I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	And share on social media could be the next step?	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.

Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.

I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?

I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I know we can both feel good about that.

Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.

20180903-163331_887_live	Hey, do you care about hungry children?	Sure	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	That sounds like a great idea!	I would love to help in anyway I can.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?
20180903-163331_887_live	Hey, do you care about hungry children?	Sure	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	How much am I allowed to donate?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?
20180903-163331_887_live	Hey, do you care about hungry children?	Sure	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!

Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	I would like to start making a difference today.

Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Oh okay.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	It will help these children in a big way.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.

YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Save the Children helps to ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Is this something that you care about?	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.

There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen

That's great!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	I know we can both feel good about that.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Is there a website where i can donate?	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	What is the easier way?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Would you like some information about the charity first?	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I am not sure I am just very biased	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?

I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	I think i will make a donation of $2	Can you tell me more about what they do?	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.

I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	So what do I need to donate?	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Do you know where I can go to donate?	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	This is the only one that comes to mind	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.

Wow, they really help people all around the world.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.

Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I little bit of know Save the children life.

Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	seeking job	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.

Are you going to donate anything at this time?	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.

So do you live in the US?	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	What was life like for you as a kid?	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.

So do you live in the US?	yes .	where are you	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I am glad you were there to help him.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.

I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I see no reason not to help this charity.

Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?

No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I'll pay $0.30 surely	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	do you know what save the children fund does?	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I hope more people think like you and me	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?

I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	And share on social media could be the next step?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	i will like to know about the opportunity first	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.

I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.

20180827-025236_792_live	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	How much do we have to share with them?	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	i can walk but that is all can do.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.

Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	How much money a year does save the children raise?	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	It's really cool.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary
20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	No thank you for the work that you do	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I think Disney World participates too.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?

I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	I think i will make a donation of $2	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	For sure.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

Are you aware of what save te children does?	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…

This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.

The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.

Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?

When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.

I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I'll donate the whole amount.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I dealt with that more when I was working.

They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?
20180826-175705_624_live	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Yes, I'm interested.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.

I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	i can walk but that is all can do.
20180826-175705_624_live	No but I can tell you about the charity!	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	I am not sure I am just very biased	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I can give $0.60 cents.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?
20180826-175705_624_live	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	What are your other plans for the day today?	I would like to start making a difference today.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?

They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.

Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.

You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	do you know what save the children fund does?	I think i will make a donation of $2	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	What more can we do for the least of these?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	What are your other plans for the day today?	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	So no	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	i said I do this for a living.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	What are your other plans for the day today?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	No thank you for the work that you do	hope things get better for you!

Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	You have plenty of rich people out there	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.

I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	How much do we have to share with them?

I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?

What is your recommendation on how we can help	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Children should be our top priority all across the world.

I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Even a couple of cents.	Whatever you can afford.	Yeah, I can do that.	A dollar?
20180719-175233_833_live	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Whatever you can afford.	Yeah, I can do that.	A dollar?
20180719-175233_833_live	You could find that out here at this website.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Yeah?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	How much do we have to share with them?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	A dollar?
20180719-175233_833_live	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I would think so?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Would you like some information about the charity first?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	every other month or so, but not to them	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.

The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?
