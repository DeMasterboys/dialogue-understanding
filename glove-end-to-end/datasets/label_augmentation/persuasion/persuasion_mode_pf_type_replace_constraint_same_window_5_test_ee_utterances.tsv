Are you going to donate anything at this time?	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	no this is my first time.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?

I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?

Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	I would like to start making a difference today.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	They have even less than your daughter has.	You can surely spare $2	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.

My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.

Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.

I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?
20180826-053811_708_live	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?

I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	And share on social media could be the next step?
20180826-180300_663_live	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	Hello	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

20180826-180300_663_live	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	Nope, what do you recommend?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	How much money a year does save the children raise?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	No thank you for the work that you do	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	What's Save the Children all about?	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.

They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!

I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Oh yeah!	Many people should be like that	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	How many people are currently donating?	42% of their funding is from US.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	You can get further details from  URL	Oh OK!	I will look into that.	So what do I need to donate?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Ok cool!	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Unfortunately I can't donate anything right now	ohh that is really sad to hear.	You can donate as little as you want.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I will keep that in mind.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I know we can both feel good about that.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day

I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	tell to family and friends is a first step	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Are you familiar with them?	No I am not.	Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

20180825-043516_619_live	Hi, I hope you are well today!	I am how are you doing?	Great!	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	No I am not.	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I'm so glad you asked!

I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Can you tell me about it?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	What can I do to help?	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.

Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	How much do we have to share with them?	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	Ok how much do you need?	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.

No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.

Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I can't work all day.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.

Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Have an awesome day and thank you again!	What is the website for Save the Children?	The web address is  URL

I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I have 10 cents I can give.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

Where is this organization based?	They are in Fairfield, CT.	You can find more information at  URL	The children need your help.	Please say yes to their most basic needs.	how many employees are there?	Save the Children employs 1500 people worldwide.	That is how much our help is needed.	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	What is the total revenue?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?

However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.

He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	Thanks for telling me about it.	What more can we do for the least of these?	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to you!	I hope you get lots of donations.

Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's a great organization!	Is it reputable?	Certainly!	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	Wonderful!	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Sounds good.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	What are your other plans for the day today?	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	It will help these children in a big way.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Good luck to you!	I hope you get lots of donations.

A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I hope you get lots of donations.

Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Good luck to you!	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.

Everyone else came from Europe or Africa	where do you came from?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	charity is a bad for that.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	yeah i did.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Would you donate then?	maybe i will do	That's great to hear.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	after i die i will donate my all..	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!
20180825-055427_625_live	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	do you know what save the children fund does?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I do the same for World Vision.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	I know we can both feel good about that.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	No thank you for the work that you do	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.

And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Sure.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Great.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.

Hassle free.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I hope more people think like you and me	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Thanks for sharing.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?

Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I glad we can help.	No thank you for the work that you do	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Every bit helps.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	God bless!	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	You.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.

I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Enjoy the rest of the day.

What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I guess so.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I propose we stick with our half plan.

20180723-052203_936_live	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	I'm doing very well thank you!	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
20180723-052203_936_live	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	How is your day going so far?

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Thank you for your time, have a great day.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?

You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.

Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	This is the only one that comes to mind	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	If only more people were more giving like you!	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.

Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	they sound like a good charity to donate to	It hurts my heart.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	What more can we do for the least of these?	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

20180723-122005_335_live	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	I used to donate to them.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	That is super important work, obviously.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	that's good to hear.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	I would highly recommend it	what other organizations would you consider?

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?

I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	I know we can both feel good about that.	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?

Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	And share on social media could be the next step?	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	So no	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.

To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	i said I do this for a living.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.

No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.

So no	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	You have plenty of rich people out there	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.

So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	i cant do that either.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	i can walk but that is all can do.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I cant stand very long	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	Oh!	this is so good.	Are you aware of what save te children does?	I know a little bit.	But do not fully know.

I am more interested in this.	Do you donate to other charities also?	Yes, But I remember what it gave me.	How much would you be willing to donate today?	I think I can give $25.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Thank you very much.	The explanations you provided were very useful.	Thank you so much.	So you will give $25 today right?	Yes i will.

What are your other plans for the day today?	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	What was life like for you as a kid?	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I'm very glad to hear that.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	With no place to live?	I think that is is awful and sad.	What do we do about it?	Have you heard about Save the Children?	Other than it mentioned today of course.	nope I have never heard of it	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause	They are a fantastic charity.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	That is awesome	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Its because I dont trust non profits	That's understandable.	Thank you for your time today.	No thank you for the work that you do	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I am not sure I am just very biased
20180723-070336_48_live	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Yea what do you got?	No but I can tell you about the charity!	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I'm very glad to hear that.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?

Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I think that is is awful and sad.	What do we do about it?	Have you heard about Save the Children?	Other than it mentioned today of course.	nope I have never heard of it	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.

I usually just try to go with half for these things.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	I think that is is awful and sad.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.

I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I am glad you were there to help him.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I've seen videos that were so heartbreaking	Yea.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Oh really?	Nice!	What can we do to help?	Would you like to help by donating?	Sure, what amount is a smaller pledge?	Even a couple of cents.	Whatever you can afford.	Yeah, I can do that.	A dollar?
20180719-175233_833_live	Hey there	Hey how's it going?	So children's charity then...	Yep.	Do you happen to be a parent?	No, not currently.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	How are they relevant to you?	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	Yes I have.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	But I"m always willing to help!	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I've seen videos that were so heartbreaking	Yea.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Oh really?	Nice!	What can we do to help?	Would you like to help by donating?

Yes I have.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Yea.	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Oh really?	Nice!	What can we do to help?	Would you like to help by donating?

I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.

I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	Sure, what amount is a smaller pledge?	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....

Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.
