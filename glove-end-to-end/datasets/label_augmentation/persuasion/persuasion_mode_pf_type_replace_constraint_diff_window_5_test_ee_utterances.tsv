I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	What kind of camera do you have?	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?

Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.

20180826-210609_644_live	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is.

I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.

For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	You could find that out here at this website.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I.

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	Literally every penny helps these children.

I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	I will donate 0.05 cents today.

20180903-163331_887_live	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	If only more people were more giving like you!	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Oh okay.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Point taken.	It is the least we can do.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	It is the least we can do.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Yes, I have.	But it's been mostly local church related activities.	That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	Okay, that sounds great!  Thanks!	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	I agree.	That sounds like a great idea!	How much am I allowed to donate?	Up to your whole 2 bucks!!	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	No, thank you!	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	No, we're done!	Thanks again.	Thank you very much!
20180903-163331_887_live	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.

They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	What more can we do for the least of these?	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.

Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.

Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	I agree.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	You could find that out here at this website.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.

I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.

20180826-180300_663_live	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Hello	How much would you be willing to donate today?	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	Nope, what do you recommend?	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	You can choose any amount from .01 to all your payment today.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	What's Save the Children all about?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	I know we can both feel good about that.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	What is the easier way?	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!

Save the Children do have a website at  URL	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.

You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	I would love to help in anyway I can.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	How many people are currently donating?	42% of their funding is from US.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	You can get further details from  URL	Oh OK!	I will look into that.	So what do I need to donate?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Ok cool!	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Unfortunately I can't donate anything right now	ohh that is really sad to hear.	You can donate as little as you want.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I will keep that in mind.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.

However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.
20180723-100855_385_live	Hi...	how are you today?	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Have you heard of it?	im doing well!	How about you?	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Im fine thank you.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Wow!	Thats awesome!	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Oh yeah!	Many people should be like that	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	How many people are currently donating?	42% of their funding is from US.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	You can get further details from  URL	Oh OK!	I will look into that.	So what do I need to donate?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Ok cool!	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Unfortunately I can't donate anything right now	ohh that is really sad to hear.	You can donate as little as you want.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Of course!	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.

How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.

What do you do for work and do you like it?	i am not working.	seeking job	I hope you find something soon.	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	God bless and good morning.

I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	In which countries do they serve?

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !

Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	Wonderful!	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	I might want to volunteer too.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Certainly.

I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Thank you for your kind donation.

The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	yeah i know how donation works.	I have 300000 immigrants in my country.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.

Do you know where I can go to donate?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I have 300000 immigrants in my country.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.

Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	i get that.	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.

Would you do it now?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	i get that.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	yeah i know how donation works.	I have 300000 immigrants in my country.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa	where do you came from?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	charity is a bad for that.	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	maybe i will do	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	yes i sure will do donate.	after i die i will donate my all..	How much would you like to donate today?

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need

No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	after i die i will donate my all..	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.
20180825-055427_625_live	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	they are good too, but this one I prefer	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I little bit of know Save the children life.	What was life like for you as a kid?	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?

What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Ok, sounds good.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.

That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	I'll donate the whole amount.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	Great.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.

This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.

It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	How much money a year does save the children raise?	Every bit helps.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?

That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?

I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Have a great day.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.

They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	How much money a year does save the children raise?	God bless!	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.

What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	You.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen

It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180808-081317_142_live	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Hello, how are you today?	maybe there are children who may die without this money	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.

Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	Interesting.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.

You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I was unaware.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!

I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	Any child that needs help deserves it.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.

I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	That is super important work, obviously.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	that's good to hear.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	I would highly recommend it	what other organizations would you consider?	This is the only one that comes to mind	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	they are good too, but this one I prefer	why is that?	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	that's a fair point	are you still there?	yes! i said that's a fair point.	save the children is a good choice.
20180723-122005_335_live	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Do you like that charity?	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?

To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?

Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?

Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I think it has to do with helping sick children.

They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.

No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?
