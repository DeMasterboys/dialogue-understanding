They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I really like their mission.	I really feel badly for the kids.	Don't you?	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.

I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	What kind of camera do you have?	I have a really old digital camera.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Do you have anything like that?

20180826-180009_407_live	Hi!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your donation can address such problems.	Oh wow, shocking news.	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Thats awesome!	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	You could find that out here at this website.	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	I am so grateful for your donation.	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Thank you, you too!

Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	I believe everyone can join to help.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I am not a member, but i donate.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	Have a good night, take care :)

You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Have a good night, take care :)

Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	There are a few for sure.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation

You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Thank you for your time and effort.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.

That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Yea...I am also feel bad that incident...	I fell so bad about it also.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Yes, I absolutely have.

20180826-210609_644_live	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.

These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	But they also assist in other ways.	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.

I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....

They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.

No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	These kids really deserve it :)	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	What was life like for you as a kid?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.

Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?

Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	That way i know where my money is going.	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?

Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	You are AWESOME!	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.

Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.

Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	Thank you :)	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

20180826-180300_663_live	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Even small amounts will definitely help	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	maybe there are children who may die without this money	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.

You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!

It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?

I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	So do you live in the US?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	VANCOUVER.

It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.

That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	God bless and good morning.

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I would like to start making a difference today.
20180825-043516_619_live	Hi, I hope you are well today!	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.

I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Same here!	They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	How much do we have to share with them?

Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.

You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Have an awesome day and thank you again!	What is the website for Save the Children?	The web address is  URL

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.

How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.

Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?

That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	That's great, if you'd like to know more about Save the Children check out their website  URL	I have problems too.	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.

That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

Do they help our children in the US as well?	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.

No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

That's awesome and generous!	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	Thank you for doing this.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.

Thank you for doing this.	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.

20180825-043516_619_live	Hi, I hope you are well today!	I am how are you doing?	Great!	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Are you familiar with them?	No I am not.	Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	The web address is  URL

Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Thanks for telling me about it.	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to you!

20180825-080131_220_live	Hello there!	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Hi.	It sounds familiar but I'm not sure.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's a great organization!	Is it reputable?	Certainly!	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	Wonderful!	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Sounds good.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Thanks for telling me about it.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	;) and haha!	You can decide how much you want to donate.	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.

I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	That's great to hear.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	yes i sure will do donate.	after i die i will donate my all..	How much would you like to donate today?

Would you take it?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Would you do it now?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	i get that.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	yeah i know how donation works.	I have 300000 immigrants in my country.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa	where do you came from?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	charity is a bad for that.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	yeah i did.	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	What amount were you thinking of donating?	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	after i die i will donate my all..	How much would you like to donate today?

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	It can be as much as you want.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	How much would you like to donate today?

Would you donate then?	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.

Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	How much would you like to donate today?
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.

20180825-055427_625_live	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	That's amazing.

Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.

No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	No thank you for the work that you do	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	How long have you been donating?	For years.

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	For years.	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.

You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	That is good.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	How much do we have to share with them?	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	Are you aware of what save te children does?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.

I little bit of know Save the children life.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.

I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	You want to join me?	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.

It won't be much but every penny counts.	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.

Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.

But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Hassle free.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	Great.

No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	That wonderful!

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	You've encouraged my heart today.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	I would like to start making a difference today.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Goodbye.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?

Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Have a wonderful day.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	I would love to help in anyway I can.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Not bad.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?

20180808-081317_142_live	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!

20180808-081317_142_live	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today?	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	I know we can both feel good about that.	No but I can tell you about the charity!	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I was unaware.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	They do everything.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.

Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	Food is just one part of it.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.

It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	every other month or so, but not to them	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.

How much would you be willing to donate today?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.

I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.

If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
20180723-052203_936_live	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I am doing well.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.

Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	How much do we have to share with them?	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Can you tell me more about what they do?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.

Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I dealt with that more when I was working.

The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	They are our future.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.

I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	maybe there are children who may die without this money	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I think i will make a donation of $2	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?

I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	And share on social media could be the next step?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.

Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	I would like to start making a difference today.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.

They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!

WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I like that they are transparent.

Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.

Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.

I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	are there any charities that you favor?	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	hope things get better for you!

It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.

I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	That's understandable.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Do they help our children in the US as well?

Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

Can you tell me more about what they do?	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	That is amazing.	Tell me more.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I would like to help.	What would you consider an acceptable contribution?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Where do I sign up?	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	You can sign up at :  URL	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	Yes, I would like to hear more.	I love helping where I can.	Those less fortunate deserve better.	These children die from hunger daily.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Do you donate to this cause as well?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	You've been great.
