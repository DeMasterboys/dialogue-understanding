So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.

20180826-180009_407_live	Hi!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	That's very good since they do so much for children.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I am so grateful for your donation.

I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I am so grateful for your donation.	It means alot to this rganization.	Of course, its a great organization to support	Have you donated to a similar charity?	Yes, a few times before	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Thank you, you too!

I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?

Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	how they managing in 120 countries?	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	some people donate whole their life and time.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I am not a member, but i donate.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	There are a few for sure.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Thank you for your time and effort.	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	Have a good night, take care :)

Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.

I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?

I understand but these children have even less than us.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	That way i know where my money is going.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?

Is there anything else I need to do?	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	All of us should be in this world together.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	maybe there are children who may die without this money	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	I think i will make a donation of $2	Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.

So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	It will help these children in a big way.

No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	every other month or so, but not to them	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Up to your whole 2 bucks!!

I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	That way i know where my money is going.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I hope more people think like you and me	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.

I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	If only more people were more giving like you!	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families

Everyone should be responsible of this issue	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.

I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!

They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?

I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?

Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.

Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?

They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.

Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	You can get further details from  URL	No thank you for the work that you do	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.

I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.

I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Oh yeah!	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I will keep that in mind.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	That is very thoughtful of you.

It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Oh yeah!	Many people should be like that	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	How much would you be willing to donate today?	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	That is very thoughtful of you.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Of course!	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day

You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?

No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I little bit of know Save the children life.

Wow, they really help people all around the world.	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	And can help these poor children in such a big way.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.

Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.

Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I see no reason not to help this charity.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.

I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?

That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Same here!	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Can you tell me more about what they do?

I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	This is the only one that comes to mind	tell to family and friends is a first step	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	How much would you like to donate to the organization?

No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	What are your other plans for the day today?	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I'm so glad you asked!	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.

I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I understand but these children have even less than us.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.

Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.

Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.

Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	This is the only one that comes to mind	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	I am not sure I am just very biased	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Have an awesome day and thank you again!	What is the website for Save the Children?	The web address is  URL

If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	Have an awesome day and thank you again!	What is the website for Save the Children?	The web address is  URL

No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	That's awesome and generous!	What more can we do for the least of these?	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?

Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.

Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	What more can we do for the least of these?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	There is no greater service than to help.	Maybe.	In which countries do they serve?	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Gods love knows no boundaries.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	You will be blessed.	I just know it!	How many children do you estimate are benefited?	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Is this organization a 501(c)(3)?	Yes it is.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?

20180825-081859_875_live	If only more people were more giving like you!	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.

I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	That is great!	No but I can tell you about the charity!	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	every other month or so, but not to them	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.

One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.

How much would you be willing to donate today?	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	What are your other plans for the day today?	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.

20180825-055427_625_live	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	They're a great charity I support.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.

20180825-055427_625_live	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.

I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	That's amazing.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.

It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	No but I can tell you about the charity!	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.

I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.

20180825-055427_625_live	That's very good since they do so much for children.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	they are good too, but this one I prefer	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	All of us should be in this world together.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	How much do we have to share with them?	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	For years.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	That way i know where my money is going.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.

I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.

Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	That's amazing.	If only more people were more giving like you!	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	every other month or so, but not to them	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	You can decide how much you want to donate.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

Even small donations have a huge impact.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	How much do we have to share with them?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	This is the only one that comes to mind	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.

Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	How much do we have to share with them?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	Are you going to donate anything at this time?	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I think i will make a donation of $2	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.

That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Great, how much would you like to donate today?	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	No thank you for the work that you do	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	every other month or so, but not to them	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I little bit of know Save the children life.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	i can walk but that is all can do.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	How much would you be willing to donate today?	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	i can walk but that is all can do.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	how much of that would you be willing to donate?	You would like to donate a dollar a day?	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.

Hassle free.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	every other month or so, but not to them	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	It will encourage our friends.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	I am not sure I am just very biased	I am not sure I am just very biased

You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.

Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?

If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Goodbye.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.

WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Not bad.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Would you like some information about the charity first?	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.

20180808-081317_142_live	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	How much money a year does save the children raise?	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.

Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.

20180808-081317_142_live	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?

20180808-081317_142_live	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	They do everything.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.

Sounds like they accomplish great things.	Are you thinking of a one time donation?	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	What are your thoughts?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Are we being selfish by keeping half?	maybe there are children who may die without this money	That's true.	I still haven't decided for sure though.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I guess so.	Have you donated to Save the Children before?	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Well, don't feel bad.	We will donate today.	I propose we stick with our half plan.	What do you think?	yes i like that plan	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	nice working with you.
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Are you aware of what save te children does?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
20180723-052203_936_live	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I am doing well.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	do you know what save the children fund does?	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.

Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	absolutely thank you so much!!	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	I see no reason not to help this charity.	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.

That way i know where my money is going.	Absolutely.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	All of us should be in this world together.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Children should be a priority in the world.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I see no reason not to help this charity.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	They are our future.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I am kind of curious about the details though.	This is the only one that comes to mind	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!

For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!

Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.

If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.

Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?

Absolutely.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	If only more people were more giving like you!	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	That's very good since they do so much for children.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.

When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	You can decide how much you want to donate.	Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Thank you!	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

They are our future exactly.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	I would love to help in anyway I can.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	That makes my heart so happy.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I would love to help in anyway I can.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I will spread the word!

They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.

Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	i can walk but that is all can do.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.

They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	That is super important work, obviously.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	What more can we do for the least of these?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	they are good too, but this one I prefer	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle

They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	That is super important work, obviously.	Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also

At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	tell to family and friends is a first step	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	It will help these children in a big way.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.

20180825-053711_81_live	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.

20180825-053711_81_live	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Have you heard of them?	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.

20180825-053711_81_live	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	do you know what save the children fund does?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.

20180825-053711_81_live	We definitely need more people like you in the world.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I know we can both feel good about that.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.

20180825-053711_81_live	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	Are you aware of what save te children does?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.

20180825-053711_81_live	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	they are good too, but this one I prefer	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	i said I do this for a living.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Are you aware of what save te children does?	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	There is a lot of info about the organization there.

That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.

I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	This is your chance to do some good.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.

They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	i can walk but that is all can do.

They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.

Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Everyone can help.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	No thank you for the work that you do	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	The money would at least go to a good cause.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	All of us should be in this world together.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.

Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	I am not sure I am just very biased	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding.

I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Would you rather donate your time?	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.

Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	And share on social media could be the next step?	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.

Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Every little thing does make a difference.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	i will like to know about the opportunity first	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Whatever you can afford.

HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	First, is your reward contingent on my donating?	Yes it is	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.

Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.
