I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Do you know that charity's mission? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.

They are based in CT. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	I feel that it would be easy to donate. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. I understand but these children have even less than us.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.

WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic. No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.

Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera. Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Do you have anything like that? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?
20180825-070900_49_live	Hi there how are you doing today?	Hey I'm fine.	How are you doing?	I am doing really good.	So, what are you up to today?	I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	I can't decide which onne.	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	How do you feel about this charity?	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Do you know that charity's mission?	They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I really like their mission.	I really feel badly for the kids.	Don't you?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered?	They are based in CT.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.

I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Could you donate anything to them? I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	yes I can. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	I can donate 10 dollars. I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Wow! It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	that is so great. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	Thank you so much. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes? I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	OH, yeah food please. I would like to start making a difference today.	Gotta feed the hungry first How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Yes! Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I think that is a great idea.

So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this? I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	no this is my first time. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	what do I do now? Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	You do not have to do anything else. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I am really glad that you donated. The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	What are your other plans for the day today? I love getting the word out there on this charity.	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on. yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? Would you like some information about the charity first?	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	What kind of camera do you have? I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I have a really old digital camera. This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good. It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.

I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	do you? No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such. It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces! St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	therefore we should do our best to make that happen I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	This is so true!

If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	okey.

I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them? The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Sure, go ahead However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Are they a non profit organization? I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Yes they are! Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	They work 100% on donated funds. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.

According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children. Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.

The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	That is awesome! Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with? Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I am so grateful for your donation. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	It means alot to this rganization. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Of course, its a great organization to support OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Have you donated to a similar charity? In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Yes, a few times before What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!

I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.

I know right, It is a big thing to do. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	some people donate whole their life and time.

On the website there is a link to donate: https://support.

You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	whetehr i acn trust this charity?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	there is no other children charity ?	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I am not a member, but i donate.

Have you every tried donation through HITs?	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	it makes me good	I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	how they managing in 120 countries?	they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	sure i will check this link.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group? Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I believe everyone can join to help. So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join. That's very good since they do so much for children.	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I know right, It is a big thing to do. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	some people donate whole their life and time. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate? I am glad you were there to help him.	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1 What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	No, itt will be anonymously. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked. Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	whetehr i acn trust this charity? Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity? OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	there is no other children charity ? Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?

Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	I am not a member, but i donate. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust. What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	There are a few for sure. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Thank you for your time and effort. maybe there are children who may die without this money	It was such a pleasure to chat with you. The money would at least go to a good cause.	Have a good night, take care :) the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)

I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.

Save the Children is a great organization. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Sounds like they really help education wise. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	They do. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	But they also assist in other ways. I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	I couldn't agree more. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	It sure does. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	ANything else I should know about this charity? I usually just try to go with half for these things.	It is a huge movement. I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? I think i will make a donation of $2	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	These kids really deserve it :) How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	Literally every penny helps these children. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello! They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before? I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Yes, I absolutely have. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	Save the Children is a great organization. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. What are your other plans for the day today?	I have not heard of Save the Children before. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Sounds like they really help education wise. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	They do. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	But they also assist in other ways. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Thats awesome! i will like to know about the opportunity first	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Wow, they really help people all around the world.	I couldn't agree more. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	It sure does. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	ANything else I should know about this charity? is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	It is a huge movement. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	These kids really deserve it :) How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Literally every penny helps these children. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Sounds like they really help education wise. they sound like a good charity to donate to	They do. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	But they also assist in other ways. It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. Do you know where I can go to donate?	Thats awesome! I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I couldn't agree more. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It sure does. Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	ANything else I should know about this charity? people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	It is a huge movement. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.

Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.

In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.

As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I will donate 0.05 cents today. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Thank you :) I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement. Have you ever donate for children in your area?	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. i will like to know about the opportunity first	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	These kids really deserve it :) Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Literally every penny helps these children. It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	There's no paying online or entering payment info. So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.

That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME! How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) they are good too, but this one I prefer	I will donate 0.05 cents today. You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

I guess I could throw them .10	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it? The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	It wouldn't hurt to give more. they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are. Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	You know they're worse off than you, right? According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Honestly < do not think so. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots.. Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude. Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children? Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	0k Here is a .25 OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you? I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also… I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children.. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though. Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	I\'m sure you could give $2 I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later. I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need? They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Then why not give some money to these kids too? They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They have even less than your daughter has. My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	You can surely spare $2 Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2). I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	>15 cents sorry maybe more next time. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?

I guess I could throw them .10	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.

My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots.. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.

Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you? I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also… I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children.. How much do we have to share with them?	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different? Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	I\'m sure you could give $2 As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need? I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids. Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Then why not give some money to these kids too? You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	They have even less than your daughter has. Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	You can surely spare $2 I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).

I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.

This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets. Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	Thats very sweet of you. Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	What did you get him? I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.

I would do the same WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Its extremely sad. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I think you can still make a difference. Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!! How much money a year does save the children raise?	Thank for helping to the cause. I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I hope more people think like you and me St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	But we can always try. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	I agree. sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	What do you have in mind? No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	tell to family and friends is a first step $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	And share on social media could be the next step? i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.

I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad. If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I think you can still make a difference. Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Great idea!! You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Thank for helping to the cause. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Everyone should be responsible of this issue cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	I agree. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. I little bit of know Save the children life.	Exactly!!!. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I hope more people think like you and me well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	But we can always try. WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	I agree. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	And share on social media could be the next step? I wish I could give more, but I am broke

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Nope, what do you recommend? i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Even small amounts will definitely help Would you like some information about the charity first?	What's Save the Children all about? I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	That would work best for me. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	That way i know where my money is going. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	Is there a minimum to donate? Wow, they really help people all around the world.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	They know that any small amount can help. Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Hello I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	Nope, what do you recommend? It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Even small amounts will definitely help HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	What's Save the Children all about? I am glad you were there to help him.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home I understand but these children have even less than us.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	That would work best for me. That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate? I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	They know that any small amount can help. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	That's great! Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Is there a website where i can donate? Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I'm glad to hear it! Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	Save the Children do have a website at  URL but it never reached to the people i heard so far	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	What is the easier way? I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Yeah, it does sound good. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I am kind of curious about the details though. they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. I understand but these children have even less than us.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going. is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Is there a minimum to donate? I little bit of know Save the children life.

At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	That's interesting and sounds good, right? If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Yeah, it does sound good. I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.

I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	It was great chatting with you. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	And thanks for helping! I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.

I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I'm so glad you asked! maybe there are children who may die without this money	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	I believe it would be a valuable experience. yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice? You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	They save miniture IG dogs. What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I adopted one years ago and she is the best. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	But children's charities are great too. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true? I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	That is great! I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Animal charities are pretty great too! Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time. Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	It's really cool. How much money a year does save the children raise?	I think Disney World participates too. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved. Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also? Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?

That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I think Disney World participates too. How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	For sure.

There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Oh that's great.	What is the name of the organization?	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	Well the have a great cause.	Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	It's heartbreaking!	I feel the same way as you do.	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	I am not sure if I have seen that picture. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I would have to see it to know. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	It made me both angry and sad.

Would you whole heartedly donate? The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	How do you know that they are effective? Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go? I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups. I hope more people think like you and me	I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Okay. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	That's good of you to donate. Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task? Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	Even a little can do a lot. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid. Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Sure I will donate 20 cents.	thank you very much If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!

It's not much, but I don't have much money.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	charity is a bad for that.

That's great to hear. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	What amount were you thinking of donating?

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	They're a great charity I support. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I sponsor 3 children. What is your recommendation on how we can help	That's amazing. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. Can you tell me more about what they do?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	How long have you been donating? Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	For years. What was life like for you as a kid?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	That is good. Do you know where I can go to donate?	I've heard good things about Save the Children. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	They're a great charity I support. It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	That's amazing. We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	How long have you been donating? Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	For years. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	That is good. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I am not sure I am just very biased	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Have you ever donate for children in your area?	They're a great charity I support. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	I do the same for World Vision. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	That is good. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	They're a great charity I support. They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I do the same for World Vision. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	I sponsor 3 children. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	That's amazing. However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	They're a great charity I support. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	I do the same for World Vision. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I sponsor 3 children. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	That's amazing. What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.

I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	I would love to make a donation today. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	That's amazing. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	That is good. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	I've heard good things about Save the Children.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	You know what, you've encouraged me. I am kind of curious about the details though.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. Would you like some information about the charity first?	You want to join me? People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	It won't be much but every penny counts. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Sure. I would like to start making a difference today.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	That's amazing. Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Probably more. So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. If only more people were more giving like you!	Hassle free. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Ok, sounds good. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I'll donate the whole amount. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	Great. How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Thanks for sharing. Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. It was such a pleasure to chat with you.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	It will encourage our friends. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	Very good.	I glad we can help.

Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years. It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. There is a lot of info about the organization there.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	That is good. My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	You know what, you've encouraged me. Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. Great, how much would you like to donate today?	You want to join me? Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	It won't be much but every penny counts. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	Sure. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	I would love to help. I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Probably more. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Hassle free. yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Ok, sounds good. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I'll donate the whole amount. Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	Great. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Thanks for sharing. How much do we have to share with them?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I'm going to blog about you later today. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	It will encourage our friends. Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Very good. they sound like a good charity to donate to	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	That is good. Do they help our children in the US as well?	I've heard good things about Save the Children. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Absolutely. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. There is a lot of info about the organization there.	You know what, you've encouraged me. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	You want to join me? I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	It won't be much but every penny counts. What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Sure. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I would love to help. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I would love to make a donation today. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	That's amazing. the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	Should we give our whole 30 cents? In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. do you know what save the children fund does?	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Hassle free. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Ok, sounds good. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I'll donate the whole amount. What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	Great. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	Thanks for sharing. without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	I'm going to blog about you later today. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	It will encourage our friends. Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	Very good. My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I glad we can help. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Every bit helps. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	You've encouraged my heart today. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Ditto to you.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	That is good. Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	I've heard good things about Save the Children. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	Absolutely. Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	You know what, you've encouraged me. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I know right, It is a big thing to do.	You want to join me? I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	Sure. therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I would love to help. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I would love to make a donation today. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	That's amazing. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Probably more. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Hassle free. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Ok, sounds good. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I'll donate the whole amount. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	Great. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Thanks for sharing. children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	It will encourage our friends. Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Very good. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I glad we can help. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	Every bit helps. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	You've encouraged my heart today. You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	Ditto to you. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Ok, sounds good. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	I'll donate the whole amount. No thank you for the work that you do	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Great. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Save the Children do have a website at  URL	It will encourage our friends. I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	Very good. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	I glad we can help. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Every bit helps. No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	You've encouraged my heart today. Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	Ditto to you. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	Have a great day. Do you know where I can go to donate?	God bless! this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	Goodbye. I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Have a wonderful day. Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	You. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Enjoy the rest of the day. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.

I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.

I would love to make a donation today. It's not much, but I don't have much money.	That's amazing. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	Probably more. every other month or so, but not to them	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	You've encouraged my heart today.

I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Great. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Thanks for sharing. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm going to blog about you later today. However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	It will encourage our friends. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	Very good. How much money a year does save the children raise?	I glad we can help. I would love to help in anyway I can.	Every bit helps. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	You've encouraged my heart today. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	Ditto to you. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	Have a great day.	God bless! That way i know where my money is going.	Goodbye. they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	Have a wonderful day. However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	You. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Enjoy the rest of the day. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Hassle free. If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Ok, sounds good. Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	I'll donate the whole amount. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	Great. I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	Thanks for sharing. from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I'm going to blog about you later today. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	It will encourage our friends. You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	Very good. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I glad we can help. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	Every bit helps. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. I understand but these children have even less than us.	You've encouraged my heart today. maybe there are children who may die without this money	Ditto to you. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	Have a great day. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	God bless!	Goodbye. If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	Have a wonderful day. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	You. Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Enjoy the rest of the day. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. No but I can tell you about the charity!	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Great, how much would you like to donate today?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	They do everything. Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Food is just one part of it. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Interesting. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	I was unaware. I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Any child that needs help deserves it. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	What is your recommendation on how we can help Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Any donation will help. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	Even if it's small. I know we can both feel good about that.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	That makes sense. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	Hello, how are you today? Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Not bad. Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. I understand but these children have even less than us.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	They do everything. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Food is just one part of it. Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Interesting. Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I was unaware. we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Any child that needs help deserves it. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	What is your recommendation on how we can help Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Any donation will help. Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Even if it's small. No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	That makes sense. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Wow, they really help people all around the world.	In this particular format, we can only accept money. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Ok that is good to know. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?

Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Even if it's small. If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	That makes sense. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!

Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.

The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything. Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Food is just one part of it. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Interesting. I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	I was unaware. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Any child that needs help deserves it. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	What is your recommendation on how we can help The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Any donation will help. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Even if it's small. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	Hello, how are you today? So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Not bad. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	They do everything. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	Food is just one part of it. no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Interesting.	I was unaware. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Any child that needs help deserves it. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	What is your recommendation on how we can help I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Any donation will help. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Even if it's small. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	That makes sense. It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	In this particular format, we can only accept money. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	Ok that is good to know. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	How would this donation be made? Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I believe you can do it it in the chat.

Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Are you aware of what save te children does?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Food is just one part of it. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Interesting. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	What is your recommendation on how we can help I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Any donation will help. well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	Even if it's small. ?

The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Oh there are quiet a few ways. That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?

Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!

It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	absolutely thank you so much!! they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Absolutely. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	Children should be a priority in the world. It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	They are our future. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	They are our future exactly. I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity? So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. Thank you for your time, have a great day.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. A productive activity to fill your free time with.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	I would like to start making a difference today. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	Thank you! In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	That makes my heart so happy. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	It hurts my heart. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Every penny counts!! I understand but these children have even less than us.	Well that sounds just great to me! Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! The money would at least go to a good cause.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I will spread the word!

I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	I understand but these children have even less than us. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	This is your chance to do some good. Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	i said I do this for a living. No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I dealt with that more when I was working.	You have plenty of rich people out there Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Everyone can help. This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	All of us should be in this world together. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? Save the Children do have a website at  URL	Would you rather donate your time? In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	i cant do that either. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	i can walk but that is all can do. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I cant stand very long Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	take your penny then Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	i suppose If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	My favorite charity is Save The Children. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Have you heard of them? I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. That's very good since they do so much for children.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	i would not doubt that all. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	This is your chance to do some good. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	i said I do this for a living. Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	What I give away takes food from my mouth. Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	You have plenty of rich people out there Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Everyone can help. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	All of us should be in this world together. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Would you rather donate your time? This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.	i cant do that either. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	i can walk but that is all can do. Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I cant stand very long I would love to help in anyway I can.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	take your penny then no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	are there any charities that you favor? Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

20180826-021724_326_live	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ? Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Yes I have. I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	It is a wonderful charity. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	That is amazing. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Tell me more. i can walk but that is all can do.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries ! Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	I would like to help. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	What would you consider an acceptable contribution? YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day. Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing. They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	Where do I sign up? Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	You can sign up at :  URL Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Yes, I would like to hear more. I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	I love helping where I can.	Those less fortunate deserve better. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	These children die from hunger daily. yes it would be a dollar from each of us	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families You can decide how much you want to donate.

I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation ! With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children. I know right, It is a big thing to do.	You can sign up at :  URL I feel that it would be easy to donate.	However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	Yes, I would like to hear more. Do they help our children in the US as well?	I love helping where I can. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Those less fortunate deserve better. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	These children die from hunger daily. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Do you donate to this cause as well? Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	If so, how much do you give? I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	I do  ! I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I think you are a wonderful person. Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Thank you so much for telling me about this. Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation . Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I admire that ! It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation ! From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	You've been great.
