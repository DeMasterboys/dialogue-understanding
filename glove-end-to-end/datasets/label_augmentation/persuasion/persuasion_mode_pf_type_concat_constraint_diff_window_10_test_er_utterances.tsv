I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.

Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	I have a really old digital camera.

Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Do you know where the charity is headquatered?	They are based in CT.	I feel that it would be easy to donate.	I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Could you donate anything to them?	yes I can.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!	that is so great.	Thank you so much.	Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	OH, yeah food please.	Gotta feed the hungry first	Yes!	I think that is a great idea.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this? For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	no this is my first time. Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	what do I do now? I wish I could give more, but I am broke	You do not have to do anything else. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I am really glad that you donated. I understand but these children have even less than us.	What are your other plans for the day today? I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.

I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too. The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know. I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	What kind of camera do you have? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	I have a really old digital camera. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one. That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good. Have you ever donate for children in your area?

Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.

These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Save the Children is a great organization. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	I have not heard of Save the Children before. I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Sounds like they really help education wise. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	They do. I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	But they also assist in other ways. I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.

These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I.

There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Yes, I absolutely have. He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. I think i will make a donation of $2	Sounds like they really help education wise. Children should be our top priority all across the world.	They do. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	But they also assist in other ways. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. How much money a year does save the children raise?	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Thats awesome! Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.

Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before? sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	Yes, I absolutely have. I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	Save the Children is a great organization. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I have not heard of Save the Children before. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Sounds like they really help education wise. What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	They do. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. Are you going to donate anything at this time?	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Thats awesome! What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Yes, it really is.

I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	I couldn't agree more. It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?

You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	It sure does. I am not sure I am just very biased	ANything else I should know about this charity? have you ever done any donation to this charity?	It is a huge movement. I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Have you ever donate for children in your area?	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	These kids really deserve it :) We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	It is a huge movement. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	These kids really deserve it :) Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Literally every penny helps these children. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I little bit of know Save the children life.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. Would you like to help and donate to them?	There's no paying online or entering payment info. What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	These kids really deserve it :) You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.

Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	There's no paying online or entering payment info. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. And share on social media could be the next step?	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I will donate 0.05 cents today. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Thank you :) you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) Are you aware of what save te children does?	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.

Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Exactly!!!. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	But we can always try. I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well It will help these children in a big way.	I agree. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	What do you have in mind? we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	tell to family and friends is a first step I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	And share on social media could be the next step? I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world. Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I agree. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Exactly!!!. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I hope more people think like you and me Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	But we can always try. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	What do you have in mind? It's not much, but I don't have much money.	tell to family and friends is a first step This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	And share on social media could be the next step? When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.

Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Exactly!!!. However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	I hope more people think like you and me It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	But we can always try. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	I agree. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	What do you have in mind? What is your recommendation on how we can help	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step? I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Nope, what do you recommend? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Even small amounts will definitely help They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	What's Save the Children all about? I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	Hello Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend? Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	Even small amounts will definitely help Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	What's Save the Children all about? Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.

In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Even small amounts will definitely help With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? every other month or so, but not to them	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too Do you know where I can go to donate?	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	That would work best for me. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	That way i know where my money is going. Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Is there a minimum to donate? Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	They know that any small amount can help. Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.

I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!

Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.

I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	It was great chatting with you. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	And thanks for helping!
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way? Can you tell me more about what they do?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	That's interesting and sounds good, right? ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Yeah, it does sound good. Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. I understand but these children have even less than us.	I am kind of curious about the details though. What are your other plans for the day today?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2 I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	That's wonderful! i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	It was great chatting with you. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	And thanks for helping! I wish I could give more, but I am broke	That's wonderful! Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. You can decide how much you want to donate.	It was great chatting with you. Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	And thanks for helping! Can I tell you about a charity important to me?

I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity! They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity. Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	Same here! We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children. So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Are you familiar with them? It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	No I am not. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Can you tell me about it? So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources do you know what save the children fund does?	That's interesting.

Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	A productive activity to fill your free time with. It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	:) Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own. Do they help our children in the US as well?	Certainly. This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed. It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	Thanks for telling me about it. i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation. It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	It's not much, but I don't have much money. What is your recommendation on how we can help	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person? It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Small changes lead to big results. HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	;) and haha! The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Yes, I am. :) What was life like for you as a kid?	Good luck to you! That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I hope you get lots of donations. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.

Everyone else came from Europe or Africa Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	where do you came from? I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.

20180826-020520_686_live	Hello!	What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	Would you take it?	i will like to know about the opportunity first	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Would you do it now?	powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	i get that.	The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	yeah i know how donation works.	I have 300000 immigrants in my country.	we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa	where do you came from?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	charity is a bad for that.	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of?	yeah i did.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Would you donate then? You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	maybe i will do Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	That's great to hear. And can help these poor children in such a big way.	What amount were you thinking of donating? Would you like some information about the charity first?	It can be as much as you want. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	have you ever done any donation to this charity? Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there. I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	yes i sure will do donate. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	after i die i will donate my all.. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	How much would you like to donate today?

I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. I dealt with that more when I was working.	I do the same for World Vision. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I sponsor 3 children. Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	That's amazing. You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. save the children is a non-profit organization that help the children all around the world.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	I do the same for World Vision. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I sponsor 3 children. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	That's amazing. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I understand but these children have even less than us.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	They're a great charity I support.

Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	How long have you been donating? And a few other local charities specifically for children.	For years. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	They're a great charity I support. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. I dealt with that more when I was working.	I do the same for World Vision. Do they help our children in the US as well?	I sponsor 3 children. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	That's amazing. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	How long have you been donating? Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	For years. Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. It will help these children in a big way.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	That's amazing.

Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	How long have you been donating? That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	For years. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.

I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing. Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.

We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. A productive activity to fill your free time with.

I would like to find out, so I can tailor the information to you.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	That is good. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	I've heard good things about Save the Children.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	How long have you been donating? But I do agree with the points you made in support.	For years. Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.

I've heard good things about Save the Children. i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Absolutely. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.

Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. What was life like for you as a kid?	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	How long have you been donating? shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	For years. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I've heard good things about Save the Children. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. i will like to know about the opportunity first	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Absolutely. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	You know what, you've encouraged me. Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	That is good. I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I think i will make a donation of $2	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	You know what, you've encouraged me. The charity also helps children in the US who are growing up in poverty.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	You want to join me? It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	It won't be much but every penny counts. No but I can tell you about the charity!	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	Sure.

Have you ever donate for children in your area?	It won't be much but every penny counts. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Sure.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	That is good. really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Absolutely. Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	You want to join me? Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	It won't be much but every penny counts. Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Sure. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	I would love to help. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I would love to make a donation today. have you ever done any donation to this charity?	That's amazing. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.

I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me? Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	It won't be much but every penny counts. tell to family and friends is a first step	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	Sure. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I would love to help. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	I would love to make a donation today. I am not sure I am just very biased	That's amazing. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Probably more. i can walk but that is all can do.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	Absolutely. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	You know what, you've encouraged me. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I understand but these children have even less than us.	You want to join me? It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I would love to help. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I would love to make a donation today. How much money a year does save the children raise?	That's amazing. Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	Probably more. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.

And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	You know what, you've encouraged me. Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	You want to join me? Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	Sure. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	I would love to help. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I would love to make a donation today. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Probably more. Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	Hassle free. I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	Ok, sounds good. I would love to help in anyway I can.	I'll donate the whole amount. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	You know what, you've encouraged me. I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	You want to join me? Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	Sure. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	I would love to help. I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I would love to make a donation today. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	That's amazing. How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Probably more. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Hassle free. Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Ok, sounds good. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I'll donate the whole amount. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

I think i will make a donation of $2	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

Ok, sounds good. we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I'll donate the whole amount. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	Great. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Ok ....what kind of charity to provide a donation...?	Thanks for sharing. I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm going to blog about you later today. As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	It will encourage our friends. What was life like for you as a kid?	Very good. Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing. Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Save the Children do have a website at  URL	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Probably more. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Hassle free. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Ok, sounds good. Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	I'll donate the whole amount. i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great. Can you tell me more about what they do?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	Thanks for sharing. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Would you like some information about the charity first?	I'm going to blog about you later today. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	It will encourage our friends. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Very good. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	I glad we can help. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Hassle free. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	Ok, sounds good. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I'll donate the whole amount. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Great. Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Thanks for sharing. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I'm going to blog about you later today. The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	It will encourage our friends. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Very good. Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I glad we can help. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Every bit helps. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	You've encouraged my heart today. Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	Ditto to you. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Thanks for sharing. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	I'm going to blog about you later today. The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	It will encourage our friends. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Very good. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I glad we can help. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	Every bit helps. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	Have a great day. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	God bless! If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Goodbye. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Have a wonderful day. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Enjoy the rest of the day. I would like to start making a difference today.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today. 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	It will encourage our friends. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Very good. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	I glad we can help. Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Every bit helps. WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	You've encouraged my heart today. I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	Ditto to you. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Have a great day. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	God bless! The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	You. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Enjoy the rest of the day. Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself

I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	You've encouraged my heart today.

It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	God bless! i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Goodbye. You could find that out here at this website.	Have a wonderful day.	You. I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Enjoy the rest of the day. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today? I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Not bad. Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. That's very good since they do so much for children.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	They do everything. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Hello, how are you today? What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Not bad.

Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	They do everything. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Food is just one part of it. I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	Interesting. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	Hello, how are you today? That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Not bad. There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	They do everything. I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Food is just one part of it. I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	Interesting. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I was unaware. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Hello, how are you today? But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Not bad. It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity I little bit of know Save the children life.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	They do everything. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Food is just one part of it. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Interesting. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	I was unaware. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Any child that needs help deserves it. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Hello, how are you today? What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Not bad. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	They do everything. The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	Food is just one part of it. Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	Interesting. is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I was unaware. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Any child that needs help deserves it. every other month or so, but not to them	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	What is your recommendation on how we can help I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Any donation will help. I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Hello, how are you today? However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Not bad. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Interesting. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	I was unaware. I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Any child that needs help deserves it. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. You could find that out here at this website.	What is your recommendation on how we can help I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Any donation will help. Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Even if it's small. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. How much would you like to donate to the organization?	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Hello, how are you today? yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Not bad. Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US I see no reason not to help this charity.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	They do everything. I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting. That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	I was unaware. What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	Any child that needs help deserves it. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	What is your recommendation on how we can help thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Any donation will help. Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	Even if it's small. Yes they are very trustworthy, and they have been around for a long time	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	That makes sense. Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?

Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. No but I can tell you about the charity!	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	They do everything. I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	Food is just one part of it. Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Interesting. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I was unaware. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Any child that needs help deserves it. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Any donation will help. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Even if it's small. HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	That makes sense. How much money a year does save the children raise?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.

Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	They do everything. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Food is just one part of it. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	Interesting. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I was unaware. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Any child that needs help deserves it.

What is your recommendation on how we can help every other month or so, but not to them	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	That makes sense. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	In this particular format, we can only accept money. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Ok that is good to know. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?

How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	That makes sense. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	In this particular format, we can only accept money. you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Ok that is good to know. I see no reason not to help this charity.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.

20180825-102556_172_live	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Can you tell me more about what they do?	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Sounds like they accomplish great things.	Are you thinking of a one time donation?	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	What are your thoughts?	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Are we being selfish by keeping half?	maybe there are children who may die without this money	That's true.	I still haven't decided for sure though.	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I guess so.	Have you donated to Save the Children before?	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	Well, don't feel bad.	We will donate today.	I propose we stick with our half plan.	What do you think?	yes i like that plan	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right? I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	yes it would be a dollar from each of us All of us should be in this world together.	OK sounds good. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	You sure? That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	yes i am sure. I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	we have a moral responsibility to help you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	Right, nice chatting with you. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	I'm proud of us. How much money a year does save the children raise?	I'm proud too.nice working with you. How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	I'm proud too. That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	nice working with you.
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you! I am glad you were there to help him.	How is your day going so far? I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I am doing well. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Have you heard of Save the Children? I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.

It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. Do you know where I can go to donate?	Children should be our top priority all across the world. How much do we have to share with them?	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Oh there are quiet a few ways. Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. I mean I am not aware of other charities i can trust.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? I little bit of know Save the children life.	absolutely thank you so much!! Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	Absolutely. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. Are you aware of what save te children does?	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. Great, how much would you like to donate today?	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	Have you heard of Save the Children? Yes, it really is.

It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.

The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Oh there are quiet a few ways. What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	absolutely thank you so much!! The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Absolutely. A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	Children should be a priority in the world. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	How long have you been supporting this charity? I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I would like to start making a difference today. I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Thank you! Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. yes it would be a dollar from each of us	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	It hurts my heart. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Every penny counts!! A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Well that sounds just great to me! I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! What if i told you that you have the opportunity of a lifetime to make a change in the world?	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	I will spread the word!

No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? no and i regret that i've been so selfish	i would not doubt that all. Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	i would not doubt that all. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	So no Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I understand but these children have even less than us. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	This is your chance to do some good. they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living. Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	You have plenty of rich people out there What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Everyone can help. Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	All of us should be in this world together. They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	Would you rather donate your time? Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	i cant do that either. Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	So no Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	I understand but these children have even less than us. It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	This is your chance to do some good. You would like to donate a dollar a day?	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	i said I do this for a living. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	You have plenty of rich people out there I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? Thank you for your time, have a great day.	Would you rather donate your time? Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	i cant do that either. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. I am not sure if I have seen that picture.	i can walk but that is all can do. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	I cant stand very long really it is pleased to hear this who s taking care of this charity?	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	I cant stand very long therefore we should do our best to make that happen	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. no and i regret that i've been so selfish	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.

So no What is your recommendation on how we can help	I understand but these children have even less than us. I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	This is your chance to do some good. Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	i said I do this for a living. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	You have plenty of rich people out there Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Everyone can help.

If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Wow so generous. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i guess were done here the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	Generous? WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	I usually just try to go with half for these things. Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that. Are you apart of this organization or just support them?	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.
