20180825-083745_516_live	Hello	Hi how are you doing today?	I am doing great!	Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	Sure.	Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	How do I donate?	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It sounds like they have a worthy cause.	Do they help our children in the US as well?	I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Very much so!	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?

They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.

I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.

And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	Have you donated to a similar charity?	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.

Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Literally every penny helps these children.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I.

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Do you know where I can go to donate?	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	I understand but these children have even less than us.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far

Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Thank you :)	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.

20180723-113128_856_live	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	Oh, that's great!	What sort of assistance do they offer specifically?	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I've been a donor and advocate for years.	It's really easy to get involved.	Oh, really?	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	That'd be fantastic!	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	They actually have an office near me then.	I'd love to visit one of their facilities.	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	If only more people were more giving like you!

20180903-103939_512_live	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	It wouldn't hurt to give more.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	You know they're worse off than you, right?	Honestly < do not think so.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	0k Here is a .25	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	They have even less than your daughter has.	You can surely spare $2	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.

Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	They have even less than your daughter has.	You can surely spare $2	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.

No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.

How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.

They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!
20180826-180300_663_live	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	All of us should be in this world together.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.

20180826-180300_663_live	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	I dealt with that more when I was working.	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?

People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	I little bit of know Save the children life.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.

I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	It was great chatting with you.	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.

But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Have an awesome day and thank you again!	What is the website for Save the Children?	The web address is  URL
20180825-043516_619_live	Hi, I hope you are well today!	I am how are you doing?	Great!	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Are you familiar with them?	No I am not.	Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	If everyone did imagine how much we could donate!	I wish I could give more, but I am broke	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	What are your other plans for the day today?	I have problems too.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	If only more people were more giving like you!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	$1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.

I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I think i will make a donation of $2	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	It benefits every where not just war torn countries	It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	That's awesome and generous!	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?

Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Thank you for doing this.	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	Thank you again.

If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Ok sure, I definitely donate my whole amount for this task.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	I know we can both feel good about that.	I will also give money today.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.

20180825-112615_516_live	Hi.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Do you currently volunteer with this charity?	I do.	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Will you consider a donation?	I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	Is this organization Christian or religious based?	It is in terms of values.	The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	What more can we do for the least of these?	How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	There is no greater service than to help.	Maybe.	In which countries do they serve?	They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	Gods love knows no boundaries.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	You will be blessed.	I just know it!	How many children do you estimate are benefited?	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	Is this organization a 501(c)(3)?	Yes it is.	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	Where is this organization based?	They are in Fairfield, CT.	You can find more information at  URL	The children need your help.	Please say yes to their most basic needs.	how many employees are there?	Save the Children employs 1500 people worldwide.	That is how much our help is needed.	How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	What is the total revenue?	Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?
20180825-112615_516_live	It will help these children in a big way.	Are you familiar with Save the Children?	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Do you currently volunteer with this charity?	I do.

20180825-112615_516_live	This is the only one that comes to mind	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.	I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.
20180825-081859_875_live	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.

Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's a great organization!	Is it reputable?	Certainly!	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Thanks for telling me about it.	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to you!

It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.

Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.

The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	If only more people were more giving like you!	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa	where do you came from?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	charity is a bad for that.

Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?

In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Everyone else came from Europe or Africa	Are you apart of this organization or just support them?

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	If only more people were more giving like you!	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?

I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	That's amazing.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I understand but these children have even less than us.

I love it when celebrities bring attention to causes.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.

I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.

Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.

When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	For years.	I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.

It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	How much do we have to share with them?	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	In 2016, we reached nearly 3 million children in need.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	And share on social media could be the next step?	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.

I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	This is the only one that comes to mind	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.

I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	Save the Children is the organization does the hard work of bringing health care, education and safety to children around the world.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	I would like to start making a difference today.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.

What do you do for work and do you like it?	That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.

Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	they sound like a good charity to donate to	Absolutely.	I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.

You know what, you've encouraged me.	Yes I think donating to charity is a very honorable thing to do.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.

Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	I hope more people think like you and me	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far	It won't be much but every penny counts.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.

It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	I know right, It is a big thing to do.	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.

My estimation of those benefited by your donation is 3 children for one year.	i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	How much would you be willing to donate today?	Have a wonderful day.	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Not bad.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?

20180808-081317_142_live	How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	The money would at least go to a good cause.	You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations?	Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.

What do you think?	yes i like that plan	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	OK sounds good.	You sure?	yes i am sure.	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Would you like to help and donate to them?	nice working with you.
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	no and i regret that i've been so selfish	I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
20180723-052203_936_live	Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	And share on social media could be the next step?	I am doing well.	Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Absolutely.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.

Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	?

20180826-175345_318_live	Hi!	I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	Yeah, what do you think about St Jude's?	I recommend Save the Children children's charity.	That's wonderful!	Do you have any specific country in mind?	No but I can tell you about the charity!	Sure!	I'd love to hear more.	Go on...	Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Have you ever sponsored a child?	If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	The usual cost is about $36 per child.	I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	That's actually quite reasonable!	I doesn't cost much.	I hope they allow for pen pals as well.	Sounds like a blessed organization.	Yes it does.	Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	I definitely.	I recognize it too.	They do lots of TV adverts.	I believe its a Christian organization.	Yes.	How much do you like to donate to the charity?	I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I am not sure I am just very biased	have you ever done any donation to this charity?	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	This is the only one that comes to mind	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money

How much are you donating?	i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.	Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Everyone can help.	One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.

All of us should be in this world together.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	i can walk but that is all can do.

You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.

I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Would you rather donate your time?	So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.

I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Would you like some information about the charity first?	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	hope things get better for you!

No thank you for the work that you do	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I am not sure I am just very biased
20180723-070336_48_live	Hey, how's it going?	Good just another Monday how about yourself?	hahah same here.	Do you have a moment to chat about social issues?	Specially the ones concerning children?	Yea what do you got?	I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	What was life like for you as a kid?	Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I'm very glad to hear that.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	I am glad you were there to help him.	How much do we have to share with them?	Have you heard about Save the Children?	Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They are a fantastic charity.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	That is awesome	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Its because I dont trust non profits	That's understandable.	Thank you for your time today.

No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	I'm very glad to hear that.	What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Other than it mentioned today of course.	I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	That is awesome	Would you like to help and donate to them?

Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	With no place to live?	people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	yes it would be a dollar from each of us	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Its because I dont trust non profits	That's understandable.	Thank you for your time today.

Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	With no place to live?	I think that is is awful and sad.	What do we do about it?	Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	They are a fantastic charity.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Its because I dont trust non profits	That's understandable.	Thank you for your time today.	No thank you for the work that you do	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?

Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	What more can we do for the least of these?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	Its because I dont trust non profits	That's understandable.	Thank you for your time today.

It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.	Would you like to help and donate to them?	If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	That's understandable.	Thank you for your time today.

But I do agree with the points you made in support.	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	From Haiti to Peru, Save the Children work to save lives every day, ensuring children are protected, healthy and able to learn.	There are ways to make a difference for sure.	HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.

Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	What amount of your task fee would you like to donate today?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.
