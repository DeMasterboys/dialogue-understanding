I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids. The money would at least go to a good cause.	Could you donate anything to them? You would like to donate a dollar a day?	yes I can. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I can donate 10 dollars.	Wow!

Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes? Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	OH, yeah food please. i can walk but that is all can do.	Gotta feed the hungry first The money would at least go to a good cause.	Yes! Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	I think that is a great idea. Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.

I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?

20180826-180009_407_live	Hi!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your donation can address such problems.	Oh wow, shocking news.	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children. The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US. And can help these poor children in such a big way.	Thats awesome! The money would at least go to a good cause.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them? Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity? I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

Hi...	How are you? Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Fine...what about you..? I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Doing well myself. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	But am upset about something I just learned Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...? Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?

What countries do they provide service to?	mainly children in developing countries.	Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	Donations are their main source of income.	What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	A lot of people like to give 30/month so it's only a dollar a day. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	however any donation helps, even just 1 dollar. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	86% goes towards the services... You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	the rest is used mainly for fundraising efforts You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Is save the children backed by any religious organizations? No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them. They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	Would you consider making a donation? Are you going to donate anything at this time?	Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	Google, Disney, target and paypal National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before. i will like to know about the opportunity first	Sounds like they really help education wise. I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	They do. Many have a better opportunity at life because they are nourished.	But they also assist in other ways. well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Oh so they do more than just help with education. That way i know where my money is going.	Thats awesome! Thanks, I don't consider myself that great, but any little difference i can make makes me feel good about myself	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I couldn't agree more. Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	It sure does. I would love to help in anyway I can.	ANything else I should know about this charity? How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	It is a huge movement. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. They work on different issues in almost 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.

They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. I would love to help in anyway I can.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I couldn't agree more. How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	It sure does. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	ANything else I should know about this charity? Tell me as much as you can about the organization.	It is a huge movement. I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.

I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. I am kind of curious about the details though.	Literally every penny helps these children. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.

I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I couldn't agree more. I don't have any personally therefore I spend my free time helping other kids by taking donations and such.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	It sure does. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	ANything else I should know about this charity? Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization?	It is a huge movement. I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	These kids really deserve it :) I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	Literally every penny helps these children. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.

I couldn't agree more. So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	It sure does. I think it is important to do all we can to help children.	ANything else I should know about this charity? It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	It is a huge movement. It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.

Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.

St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. They serve all African countries and all continents except Antartica.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. Children should be our top priority all across the world.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	These kids really deserve it :) Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Literally every penny helps these children. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	These kids really deserve it :) So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Literally every penny helps these children. I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. I am kind of curious about the details though.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	You are AWESOME! That's very good since they do so much for children.	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Literally every penny helps these children. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	You are AWESOME!

Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens? Are you hoping that the money goes to a certain cause like food or clothes?	Point taken. Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	It is the least we can do. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	The money would at least go to a good cause. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	It is the least we can do. What more can we do for the least of these?	The money would at least go to a good cause. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Yes, I have. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.

So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are. It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.

Honestly < do not think so. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..

20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area? What was life like for you as a kid?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	And a few other local charities specifically for children. Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	Have you ever donated to children? Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	Yes, I have. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	I remember a kid that lives on the streets. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	Thats very sweet of you. Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	What did you get him? Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.

No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	Great idea!! Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Thank for helping to the cause. I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Everyone should be responsible of this issue Yes, and your donation would be essential in helping ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety.	I agree. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?

I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer? Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give. I would love to help in anyway I can.	Exactly!!!. Have you thought about giving to the Save the Children charity?	I hope more people think like you and me I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	But we can always try. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I agree. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	What do you have in mind? I little bit of know Save the children life.	tell to family and friends is a first step And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	And share on social media could be the next step?
20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? you can help by being part of us, do you want to help?	Nope, what do you recommend? Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. I feel that it would be easy to donate.	Even small amounts will definitely help Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	What's Save the Children all about? Do they help our children in the US as well?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. This charity also support children in the United States as well as Rohingya.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say. That's very good since they do so much for children.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	That would work best for me. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	That way i know where my money is going. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Is there a minimum to donate? That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	They know that any small amount can help. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	I'm glad to hear it! I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good.	Save the Children do have a website at  URL It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate They help children make sure they have access to health resources, education, and safe environments.	What is the easier way? I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once. You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	That's interesting and sounds good, right? There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.

Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	That would work best for me. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	That way i know where my money is going. Children should be our top priority all across the world.	Is there a minimum to donate? Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	They know that any small amount can help. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	That's great!

The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good. How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	Of course it's your decision, in the end. yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	I am kind of curious about the details though. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I think i will make a donation of $2 I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	That's wonderful! I am not sure I am just very biased	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	It was great chatting with you. I little bit of know Save the children life.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful! Convince your partner their donation will make a tangible impact for the world	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on. One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	It was great chatting with you. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	And thanks for helping! While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.

I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Great! I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity! That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Same here! Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Are you familiar with them? I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	No I am not. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	Can you tell me about it?

It takes so little money to help feed a starving child. In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.

In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Isn't that amazing? For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.

No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I have 10 cents I can give. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	That's awesome and generous! While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Thank you for doing this.

Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.

How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.

Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities? How much do we have to share with them?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities. I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children? Are you apart of this organization or just support them?

That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I strongly identify with their causes and goals. yes it would be a dollar from each of us	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time? from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same. Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents. I think i will make a donation of $2	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	But I do agree with the points you made in support. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money? Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause. Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?

And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.

20180825-080131_220_live	Hello there!	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Hi.	It sounds familiar but I'm not sure.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's a great organization!	Is it reputable?	Certainly!	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	Wonderful!	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Sounds good.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience. I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	A productive activity to fill your free time with. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	:) I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Certainly. Great, how much would you like to donate today?	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	Thanks for telling me about it. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	You are welcome! Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Thank you for your kind donation. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	It's not much, but I don't have much money. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	;) and haha! yes it would be a dollar from each of us	Yes, I am. :) So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	Good luck to you! No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I hope you get lots of donations. I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.

Everyone else came from Europe or Africa Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	where do you came from? from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	charity is a bad for that. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Have you ever made a donation that you have been proud to be a part of? How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	yeah i did.	but it never reached to the people i heard so far Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.

This is the only one that comes to mind	maybe i will do people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	That's great to hear. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	What amount were you thinking of donating? What are your other plans for the day today?	It can be as much as you want. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	have you ever done any donation to this charity? i hope you will also donate to make a wish.	I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. I know right, It is a big thing to do.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Hi, how much do you know about Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support. i help with everything they say to me, now im helping finding people donating, thank you for the donation today, god bless you.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision. we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	I sponsor 3 children. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	That's amazing. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.

I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	Absolutely. Thank you for your time, have a great day.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	You know what, you've encouraged me. That's fantastic - the children will definitely appreciate it!	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	You want to join me? What are your other plans for the day today?	It won't be much but every penny counts. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Sure.	I would love to help. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I would love to make a donation today. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	That's amazing. cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	Should we give our whole 30 cents? I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Probably more. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? How much do we have to share with them?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Hassle free. It will help these children in a big way.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Absolutely. Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	You know what, you've encouraged me. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I think half is a good idea I will do the same thing	You want to join me? That's very good since they do so much for children.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	Sure. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	That's amazing. Hi, can I interest you in making a donation to Save the Children?	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	Probably more. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? How much do we have to share with them?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	Hassle free. That's very good since they do so much for children.	Ok, sounds good. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

Absolutely. How much would you like to donate to the organization?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	You know what, you've encouraged me. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I have not yet through this charity, but it is my charity of choice for my next sponsored child	You want to join me? Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	It won't be much but every penny counts. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Sure. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I would love to help. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing. I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	Should we give our whole 30 cents? I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Are you going to donate anything at this time?	Probably more. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	Hassle free. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Ok, sounds good. I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	I'll donate the whole amount. I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	Probably more. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Hassle free. I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	Ok, sounds good. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I'll donate the whole amount. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I am glad you were there to help him.	Thanks for sharing. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	I'm going to blog about you later today. I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	It will encourage our friends. That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	Very good. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I glad we can help. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Every bit helps. Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.

That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. What are your other plans for the day today?	Probably more. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	Hassle free. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Ok, sounds good. i can walk but that is all can do.	I'll donate the whole amount. I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Great. No thank you for the work that you do	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	I'm going to blog about you later today. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	It will encourage our friends. What do you do for work and do you like it?	Very good. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	I glad we can help. I am not sure I am just very biased	Every bit helps. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	Hassle free. I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	Ok, sounds good. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I'll donate the whole amount. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	Great. i can walk but that is all can do.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	I'm going to blog about you later today. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	It will encourage our friends. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Very good. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I glad we can help. Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	Every bit helps. every other month or so, but not to them	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	You've encouraged my heart today. cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	I'm going to blog about you later today. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	It will encourage our friends. Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	Very good. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I glad we can help. Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Every bit helps. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. I know we can both feel good about that.	You've encouraged my heart today. Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.	Ditto to you. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Have a great day.	God bless! I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Goodbye. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	Have a wonderful day. How much would you be willing to donate today?	You. I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Enjoy the rest of the day. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.

Your donation is part of the solution and you realize how it is a morally responsibility obligation .	I'm going to blog about you later today. Thank you for your time, have a great day.	It will encourage our friends. I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	Very good. Wow, they really help people all around the world.	I glad we can help. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Every bit helps. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	You've encouraged my heart today. Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?	Ditto to you. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Have a great day. ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	God bless!	Goodbye. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Have a wonderful day. You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	You. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!	Enjoy the rest of the day. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad. I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	They do everything. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	Food is just one part of it. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend! Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	Hello, how are you today? And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Not bad.

Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. they either have parties, or they travel to those countries.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	They do everything. They give money to help children in other countries and get them away from viloence.	Food is just one part of it. Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	Interesting. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	I was unaware. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Any child that needs help deserves it. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?

Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity How much money a year does save the children raise?

Save the Children does whatever it takes, every day and in times of crisis, to give children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Just out of curiosity, what developing countries does this charity focus on ?	They do everything. They work for the rights of children in developing countries in safety, health, education	Food is just one part of it. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Interesting. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I was unaware. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	Any child that needs help deserves it. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. What more can we do for the least of these?

Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?

I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?

Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.

It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	What is your recommendation on how we can help Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	Any donation will help. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Even if it's small. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Interesting. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I was unaware. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	Any child that needs help deserves it. therefore we should do our best to make that happen	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help. Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	Even if it's small. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	That makes sense. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Ok that is good to know. I dealt with that more when I was working.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything. They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Food is just one part of it. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Interesting. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I was unaware. i can walk but that is all can do.	Any child that needs help deserves it. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	What is your recommendation on how we can help Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Any donation will help. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	Even if it's small. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	Ok that is good to know. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	How would this donation be made? Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	I believe you can do it it in the chat. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	Ok that sounds easy enough. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.

They do everything.	Food is just one part of it. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Interesting. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I was unaware. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Any child that needs help deserves it. When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	What is your recommendation on how we can help okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	Any donation will help. Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	Even if it's small. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	That makes sense. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. You can decide how much you want to donate.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. That's great, I guess the donation will be deducted from your turk payment for this task directly.	Ok that is good to know. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	What was the monetary donation you were seeking? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	How would this donation be made? SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	I believe you can do it it in the chat. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Ok that sounds easy enough. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ? Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?

How would this donation be made? even a normal people from middle class can join in that group?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today? I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far? I dealt with that more when I was working.	I am doing well. How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Have you heard of Save the Children? Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. They do things like supporting children in warzones all over the world.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. therefore we should do our best to make that happen	Children should be our top priority all across the world. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today? Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I'm doing very well thank you! I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well. I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	Have you heard of Save the Children? Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? Do they help our children in the US as well?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. they sound like a good charity to donate to	Children should be our top priority all across the world. That way i know where my money is going.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today? So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	I'm doing very well thank you! I am not sure I am just very biased	How is your day going so far? I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	I am doing well. tell to family and friends is a first step	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. No but I can tell you about the charity!	Have you heard of Save the Children? I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. I agree, that doesn't happen with this charity, most of the money goes to helping the children	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Save the Children is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety and other things.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? How does the organization go about determining who and where to support?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. yes it would be a one time donation that will be taken from the payment from the task.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? I think i will make a donation of $2	absolutely thank you so much!! Please donate your fee to this important charity or at least part of it.

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.

I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Absolutely. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	I love getting the word out there on this charity. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Children should be a priority in the world. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	They are our future. It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	They are our future exactly. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity? from the begining you ae talking about this chaarity only not others are you a member of this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I would like to start making a difference today. I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. I little bit of know Save the children life.	Thank you! I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity. No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Thank you! I am recommending that you donate to a kids charity	That makes my heart so happy. I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? I understand but these children have even less than us.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	It hurts my heart. I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	Every penny counts!! I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others! Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity! I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I will spread the word! I think I can definitely afford $1 a day.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Have you heard of them? Have you ever heard about "Save the Children" before?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?

How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	Have you heard of them? Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. They donate to ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!	i would not doubt that all. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	i suppose i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	My favorite charity is Save The Children. I know right, It is a big thing to do.	Have you heard of them? Good Morning, Have you heard at the charity Save the CHildren ?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them i asked in the previous chat what is the procedure to donate?	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. I sure have, that is why i can cofidently say that now only will your money be going where you want it to but it will be put to good use when it gets there.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?	i would not doubt that all. every other month or so, but not to them	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	So no No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	This is your chance to do some good. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	My favorite charity is Save The Children. I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	Have you heard of them? Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	So no That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I understand but these children have even less than us. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	This is your chance to do some good. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	i said I do this for a living. I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Have you heard of them? I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. These are kids we're talking about they know nothing but war going on and you already mentioned you give to St Jude.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.	i would not doubt that all. Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	So no No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us. I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?	This is your chance to do some good. We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	i said I do this for a living. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	You have plenty of rich people out there yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

So no I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I understand but these children have even less than us. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	This is your chance to do some good.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. Save the Children is important because it supports protecting kids' rights to education and health and safety	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	i would not doubt that all. OK, so that will be one dollar each, right?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	So no That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I understand but these children have even less than us. It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	This is your chance to do some good. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	You have plenty of rich people out there Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Everyone can help. A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	All of us should be in this world together. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	Would you rather donate your time? Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	i cant do that either. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	i can walk but that is all can do. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!	i would not doubt that all. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. I'll have the research team collect the donate and send it to Save the Children.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	So no That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I understand but these children have even less than us. It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	This is your chance to do some good. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	i said I do this for a living. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Everyone can help. I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	All of us should be in this world together. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? I know I could give up spending on this and it would help the kids.	Would you rather donate your time? Would you like some information about the charity first?	i cant do that either. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	i can walk but that is all can do. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I cant stand very long Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	So no I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I understand but these children have even less than us. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	This is your chance to do some good. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	i said I do this for a living. I wish I could give more, but I am broke	What I give away takes food from my mouth. Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	All of us should be in this world together. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? they are good too, but this one I prefer	Would you rather donate your time?

I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	i can walk but that is all can do. Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	I cant stand very long No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	i said I do this for a living. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	What I give away takes food from my mouth. shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	You have plenty of rich people out there I tend to like St Jude's research hospital too	Everyone can help. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	All of us should be in this world together. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	Would you rather donate your time? Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	i can walk but that is all can do. I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I cant stand very long Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.

I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	Would you rather donate your time?

Even small donations have a huge impact.	take your penny then Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	are there any charities that you favor? Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	save the children but hurt me Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	I cant stand very long thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	take your penny then I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	are there any charities that you favor? is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	save the children but hurt me Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	i have my own low times. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you! One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Oh nice thats sounds likes a good cause	They are a fantastic charity. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	That is awesome I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	Would you like to help and donate to them? Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause. No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	Its because I dont trust non profits I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	That's understandable. Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Thank you for your time today.	No thank you for the work that you do	Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	I am not sure I am just very biased
