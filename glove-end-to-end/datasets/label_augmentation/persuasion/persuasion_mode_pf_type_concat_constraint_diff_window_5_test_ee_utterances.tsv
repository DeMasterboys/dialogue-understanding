Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures? well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.

When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	I have heard the cameras on the new smartphones are good. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures? Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Do you have anything like that?

I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello! However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have. The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Save the Children is a great organization. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	I have not heard of Save the Children before. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. You can also donate at the end of this HIT, It can be any amount even 0, You'll be asked.	It sure does. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	ANything else I should know about this charity? If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	It is a huge movement. is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. A million drops  of water make an ocean of aid.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	These kids really deserve it :) While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	You are AWESOME! I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.

I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :) I was going to ask you if you would be interested in donating to Save the Children.

They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	And a few other local charities specifically for children. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Have you ever donated to children? Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.

How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.

Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	I hope more people think like you and me hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	But we can always try. Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well It is based entirely on need which is mostly in third world countries.	I agree.	What do you have in mind? Children should be our top priority all across the world.	tell to family and friends is a first step It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	And share on social media could be the next step? It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.

If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	But we can always try. this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I agree. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step I know I spend on little things like a candy bar or gum.	And share on social media could be the next step? I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.

Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	What do you have in mind? Ok, and if I choose to donate from my payment it will go to Save The Children?	tell to family and friends is a first step Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	And share on social media could be the next step?

Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. It is one of the best organizations I know of that actually effective in using donations in a positive way to help children throughout the world.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?

They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!

The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Wow!	Thats awesome!	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Oh yeah!	Many people should be like that	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	How many people are currently donating?	42% of their funding is from US.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	You can get further details from  URL	Oh OK! YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	I will look into that. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	So what do I need to donate? i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. I donated before, since they have very clear financial reports on their website and they are connected to other big organizations I trust them.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Ok cool!	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause Thank you so much for telling me about this.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. Are you going to donate anything at this time?	Unfortunately I can't donate anything right now How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	ohh that is really sad to hear.	You can donate as little as you want.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	I will keep that in mind.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	That is very thoughtful of you.	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Of course!	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day

Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Are you familiar with them?	No I am not.	Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	I have problems too. As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.

They provide kids with the basic things they need like food and clothing.	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous! I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	Thank you for doing this. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I will also give money today. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life! They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.

How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.

Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.

Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	For sure. How much money a year does save the children raise?	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit. What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization?	I have a very rudimentary understanding.	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!

Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure. Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	I definitely agree with all those points. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not. Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

Certainly!	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	Wonderful! Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	Sounds good. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer? I dealt with that more when I was working.	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	It's a very rewarding experience. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	A productive activity to fill your free time with. That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	:) we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Thanks for telling me about it.	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to you!	I hope you get lots of donations.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	They're a great charity I support. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. It promotes children's rights and provides relief in developing countries	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision. I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	I sponsor 3 children. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	That's amazing. Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Your donation will be deducted from your payment in this task.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. When you figure the time we spend on buying unnecessary things like candy, car washes, or dining out, we can support these children in developing countries !	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	They're a great charity I support. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	That's amazing. Save the Children do have a website at  URL	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. can I tell you about a charity called Save the Children?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. What more can we do for the least of these?	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Is there anything we could do in the future to assure people like you that we use the money towards helping children?	They're a great charity I support. Have you heard of the separation of kids from their parents at the Mexico-US border lately?	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. Printed pictures all the way for me, it's what I know.	I do the same for World Vision. Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing. I want you to know that whatever you decide to donate will be taken from the amount you make from completing this task.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Every gift makes a world of difference for a child in need.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.

I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. I am kind of curious about the details though.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. Are you aware of what save te children does?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating? ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	For years. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. Did you ever have to worry about having enough to eat, where to live, etc?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.

And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	Should we give our whole 30 cents? As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	You want to join me? I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	It won't be much but every penny counts. I'm not sure about religious organizations but several large companies partner with them.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. I would like to think of supporting a child by $1 a day or $30 a month.	Sure. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today. No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	That's amazing. They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	It won't be much but every penny counts. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor.	Sure. if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	I would love to help. So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing. The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Their website is  URL if you would like to read more	Probably more.

That's amazing. they feed the children where is a child in difficulties , they now are helpin Hawaii with the hurricane	Should we give our whole 30 cents? St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.

Should we give our whole 30 cents? You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	Probably more. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	Thanks for sharing. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	Great. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing. How much do we have to share with them?	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Great. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	I'm going to blog about you later today. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	It will encourage our friends. Save the Children do have a website at  URL	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	I'm going to blog about you later today.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day. I would like some more information before deciding to donate.	God bless! SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Goodbye. This is a wonderful charity that has been around for many years!	Have a wonderful day. If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	You. Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	Enjoy the rest of the day.

What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.

Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?

No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	I am doing well. Yeah I'm going to donate a couple dollars after this.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	Have you heard of Save the Children? This is the only one that comes to mind	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.

They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need Then why not give some money to these kids too?	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. You would like to donate a dollar a day?	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!

Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I would like to start making a difference today. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you! I want to talk to you about a charity called Save the Children	That makes my heart so happy. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.
