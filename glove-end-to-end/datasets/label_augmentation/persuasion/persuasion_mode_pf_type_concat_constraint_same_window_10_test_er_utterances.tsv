20180826-180009_407_live	Hi!	Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Do you mind if i give you a little information about them?	Sure, go ahead	Just some ver basic info, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Are they a non profit organization?	Yes they are!	They work 100% on donated funds.	There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	Your donation can address such problems.	Oh wow, shocking news.	Do you know how many children have been helped due to this organization? What kind of health benefits to they provide to the children?	According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children. Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Over 200k of those kids were in the US. Not only are they helping children worldwide, they're helping kids closer to home near the US as well.	Thats awesome! Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Are you apart of this organization or just support them? Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity? How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You just tell me how much do you like to donate to the charity now?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c I think maybe $30 when I get my check next Tuesday.	That is awesome! Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas I would love to help in anyway I can.	I am so grateful for your donation. Great, how much would you like to donate today?	It means alot to this rganization. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Of course, its a great organization to support people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Have you donated to a similar charity? Would you like to hear about ways you can help Save the Children today!	Yes, a few times before Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening! It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Thank you, you too! I usually just try to go with half for these things.

Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them. Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	I have not heard of Save the Children before. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	Sounds like they really help education wise. I like to support organizations that are Christian based and help further the spread of the Gospel to all of God's children.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. Save the Children do have a website at  URL	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Oh so they do more than just help with education. My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	Thats awesome!

Our founder also won a Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. For children in developing countries, especially in war zones.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. It's not much, but I don't have much money.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?

These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Sounds like they really help education wise. powerful people cause war and war cause hunger, and we average people sit on our chair try to donate some money to the poor	They do. Did you know they are actively providing shelter and food to these children in active war zones?	But they also assist in other ways.

That's very good since they do so much for children.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. A productive activity to fill your free time with.	It sure does. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	ANything else I should know about this charity? Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? That wonderful! Is there anything else I need to do?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	These kids really deserve it :) The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. is there any procedure to join as a member in that group?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. I am kind of curious about the details though.	Literally every penny helps these children. If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome! There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. It's an international organization that promotes education, health and safety for all children.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids. I see no reason not to help this charity.	I couldn't agree more. Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	It sure does. I have a lot of nieces and nephews and have worked with children in the past so I have a good amount of experience with them, from all shapes and sizes	ANything else I should know about this charity? Do they help our children in the US as well?	It is a huge movement. However, before you do, I'd like to tell you a bit more	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help. I see, so I am thinking of donating half.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids? Do you know where I can go to donate?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	These kids really deserve it :) If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Literally every penny helps these children. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. I feel that it would be easy to donate.

The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. I've been thinking about donating to a children's charity.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Do you know where I can go to donate?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	These kids really deserve it :) Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. In this particular format, we can only accept money.	Literally every penny helps these children. I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point. No child deserves to feel unsafe and go hungry.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? What is the standard monthly donation someone usually gives.	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	There's no paying online or entering payment info. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	You are AWESOME! Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? but it never reached to the people i heard so far	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :) You can make your choice now or after I've told you more about the charity.	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. we are about making a donation to a fund named save the children	Literally every penny helps these children. They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it? How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. You can decide to give part of the payment to save the children and keep part for yourself.	There's no paying online or entering payment info. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :) It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	You are AWESOME! Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	How much of your payment would you like to donate today? Thank you for your time, have a great day.	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Thank you :) I know right, It is a big thing to do.	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :) I also have a smartphone, but I am thinking about getting a newer one.	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!! Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?

I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	They have even less than your daughter has.	You can surely spare $2	no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.

I would do the same I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I think you can still make a difference. Well, if you make a donation to Save the Children i can gaurantee that you will know where it goes.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year? Have you ever worked with children with were born to poorer families?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff. I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho. I would like to start making a difference today.	Great idea!! I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	Thank for helping to the cause. Would you like to be apart of this great charity and donate today?	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?
20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate for children in your area?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you. Yeah I have, what an awful situation that is.	What did you get him? Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	They get him a house and warm food I usually donate a good part of my bonus in different studies, but I specially have a soft heart for children.	Thats amazing. i will like to know about the opportunity first	I am glad you were there to help him. they sound like a good charity to donate to	I would do the same without a doubt, every kid on this planet deserves the best.

It will help these children in a big way.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world. Just the essentials can make a child lead a more fulfilled and loving life	Everyone should be responsible of this issue Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I agree. every other month or so, but not to them	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money? Is there anything else you would like to know as you generously commit your fee?	Nope, what do you recommend? Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. ? At least you know some of this money will go to save lives	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	Even small amounts will definitely help Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	What's Save the Children all about? Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate they collect charities and help the children by schooling them , feeding them, curing them.	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	Hello I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend? I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income. Your $1 a day will help their essential needs like health, education safety and clothing.	Even small amounts will definitely help But it will make a huge difference for those in need.	What's Save the Children all about? How much money a year does save the children raise?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria. they promote childrens rights, help with medical treatment if necessary	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate This year we are on track to hit 3 million thanks to generous people like you!	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA? It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	They know that any small amount can help. Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	That's great! The money would at least go to a good cause.

What is the easier way? Do you know where I can go to donate?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.

It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right? WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Yeah, it does sound good. cool, you just have to agree to give some amount of your bonus, you can give how much you want.	Of course it's your decision, in the end. 9% fundraising and 5% goes towards keeping the charity running like salaries etc	I am kind of curious about the details though. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment. The research team will collect the donation and send it to Save the Children.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.

It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!

20180723-100855_385_live	Hi...	how are you today?	The research team is helping an organization called 'Save the Children'.	Have you heard of it?	im doing well!	How about you?	I have heard about it but would love to learn more about it	Im fine thank you.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Wow!	Thats awesome!	Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.	There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	It would be great if you can make a contribution from your side for this venture.	I would love to help in anyway I can.	I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	Oh yeah!	Many people should be like that	Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	How many people are currently donating?	42% of their funding is from US. I help spread the word about our organization and encourage people to donate.	National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources. They are ranked very highly with groups that rate charities such as Forbes, BBB and other charity rating groups.	You can get further details from  URL They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	Oh OK! I think it has to do with helping sick children.	I will look into that. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	So what do I need to donate? What percentage of my donation actually makes it to the children?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. If you have any questions about where your donation goes or anything, you can go do  URL and follow up on your donation	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	Ok cool! No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause Yes definitely, I ready to help other contry children also	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. I think it would be good to donate your payment to Save the Children, it could help alot of kids out	Unfortunately I can't donate anything right now I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	ohh that is really sad to hear. Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	You can donate as little as you want. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	But it will make a huge difference for those in need. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	I will keep that in mind. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	When I get my next paycheck I will go to the website and donate. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	That is very thoughtful of you. I have some of the paper work together ho much did you want to donate right now again?	Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Of course!	Hope you have an amazing rest of the day

They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity And share on social media could be the next step?	That is very thoughtful of you.

I have heard of it but don't know much about what they do.	where are you And share on social media could be the next step?	I'm in Arizona where it is very HOT! I am just a supporter but I would like to ask how much do you like to donate to the charity?	Where are you? Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	VANCOUVER. No thank you for the work that you do	WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Van couver in the US? Appreciate your consideration of doing such an act for a greater course.	Is that in Washington state? You sound like someone who would really appreciate what Save the Children does.	I don't work cause I already retired.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.

Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	God bless and good morning.
20180827-033451_673_live	Hi there, how are you this morning?	ya fine morning what about you	Good thanks.	I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Have you heard of them?	Yes I know that organization.	you have idea donate to that charity	Yes I'm going to donate and thought you might want to also.	They do great work, very legitimate and een around 100 years.	ok nice.	how much u pay	I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	It doesn't take much to make a difference. I love getting the word out there on this charity.	Family all grown up. This is the only one that comes to mind	ok. than how is you family Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor. The majority of funds go directly to the basic care needs of children.	This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too. That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	oh ok. i love children's very much. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	so i donate that charity ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	You will? Okay I would like to tell you a little bit more about it!	That's great. It will help these children in a big way.	I know we can both feel good about that. I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	So do you live in the US?	yes . i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	where are you I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	I'm in Arizona where it is very HOT! I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	Where are you? You would like to donate a dollar a day?	VANCOUVER. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	Van couver in the US? Then why not give some money to these kids too?	Is that in Washington state? Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !	I don't work cause I already retired. So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	LOL	why you laugh.	i am also laughing .didn't tell anything	Just happy to be through with working.	What do you do for work and do you like it?	i am not working.	seeking job	I hope you find something soon.	Do you think you will be able to donate 10 cents to the charity?

Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Isn't that amazing? I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now. I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too. I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I can't work all day. What I give away takes food from my mouth.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. What are your other plans for the day today?	I have problems too. I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house. St Jude's is one specific area, Save the children goes into more of a variety of issues	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar... I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	I have 10 cents I can give. I would like to donate $2 then.  Thank you!	That's awesome and generous! How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	Thank you for doing this. HaHaHa ok so how much do you want to donate	I will also give money today. I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life! I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	Wonderful. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	I am so happy I can help. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Thank you again.

I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous! I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Thank you for doing this. We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	I will also give money today. I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life! We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Wonderful. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I am so happy I can help.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you aware of Save the Children organization? Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	I have a very rudimentary understanding. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	I think it has to do with helping sick children. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization. Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries. On the website there is a link to donate: https://support. URL ite/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1	That is a great cause. The money would at least go to a good cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	Especially animal organizations. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.

20180825-080131_220_live	Hello there!	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Hi.	It sounds familiar but I'm not sure.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's a great organization!	Is it reputable?	Certainly!	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15. The payment of the task is 30 cents, I would donate 10c	Wonderful! I help collect donations so the optimum number of children can be helped.	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children. This is a charity for children that are victims of war and hard times.	Sounds good. You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer? If so, how much does it take to take care of a sweet child on average?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	That's interesting. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I might want to volunteer too. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	It's a very rewarding experience. I've talked to someone who worked there and she already traveled to Africa.	A productive activity to fill your free time with. I have given to this charity before and I have followed them online and in newspaper reports	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	Certainly. Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed. Yes, it may be little as the price of a candy.	Thanks for telling me about it. Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.	You are welcome! Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	Thank you for your kind donation. So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?	It's not much, but I don't have much money. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person? Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	Small changes lead to big results. $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to you!	I hope you get lots of donations.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. they sound like a good charity to donate to	I do the same for World Vision. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I sponsor 3 children. Oh so they do more than just help with education.	That's amazing. URL do you have an idea of how much you would like to donate?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	That's amazing. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.

I do the same for World Vision. I wish everyone was equally ok and I know that everybit counts	I sponsor 3 children. I see no reason not to help this charity.	That's amazing. This is the only one that comes to mind	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend. Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children? hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	They're a great charity I support. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them. I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need. Although obviously I think those charities are important and relevant even to me	I do the same for World Vision. They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	I sponsor 3 children. The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	That's amazing. What are your other plans for the day today?	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. I believe u would make a tangible impact on these children.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	How long have you been donating? okay i have a check is it any discloser of our identity in donating low or high amount	For years. You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. What do you do for work and do you like it?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. What more can we do for the least of these?	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?

I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. $1 a day can be used in meaningful ways to help these children	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	How long have you been donating? How much do we have to share with them?	For years. You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. So that will be a total of .25 being donated in this conversation alone.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. It will help these children in a big way.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. you can read more on this link:  URL s/about-us/leadership-and-trustees	That is good. The money would at least go to a good cause.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. Great, especially we help to give personal care and health care products to children is necessary	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. I am somewhat of a tight budget, but I always make room for good causes.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	Absolutely. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.

When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids. It would be really great if we gave some money to save the children	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make. Thanks, especially Syria children affect more so I really worried about his future.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	How long have you been donating? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	For years. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. I hope more people think like you and me	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. You would like to donate a dollar a day?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. they provide them access to doctors and medicine that they wouldnt normally get.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. the research team collects all donations and sends it to Save the Children. :-)	That is good. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. Children should be our top priority all across the world.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I am glad you were there to help him.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. I would like to start making a difference today.	Absolutely. tell to family and friends is a first step	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.

I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch. What more can we do for the least of these?	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. n 2016, Save the Children helped more than 3 million children in Syria and surrounding countries, providing primary health care, nutrition, education and psychosocial services to child refugees and their families.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.

You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc. well let me tell you a little bit about the charity first	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	That is good. Yeah, I have one, but I don't use the camera.	I've heard good things about Save the Children. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.

I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. That is why I am going to donate a small amount to the Save The Childrten charity.	You want to join me? That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	It won't be much but every penny counts. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Sure. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	I would love to help. Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I would love to make a donation today. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	That's amazing. Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? I know your money is probably tight but 10 cents is not too much to do is it?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	I would love to help. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	I would love to make a donation today. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	That's amazing. yes it would be a dollar from each of us	Should we give our whole 30 cents? It is a great relief that there are people like you who still cares.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. No but I can tell you about the charity!	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii. They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	That is good. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	I've heard good things about Save the Children. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them. They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well. If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	Absolutely. I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	You know what, you've encouraged me. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I give $30 a month Save the children is international and helps children in all nations	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Sure. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I would love to help. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I would love to make a donation today. YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	That's amazing. What more can we do for the least of these?	Should we give our whole 30 cents? It's awesome to see the smiles on their faces!	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Would you like to help and donate to them?	Probably more. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.

I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Absolutely. So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe. No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	You know what, you've encouraged me. Wont you please donate some part of your payment for this task?	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children. I thought maybe 10 or 15 cents of my pay.	You want to join me? My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Sure.

It's nice to know that people are donating to such a great cause	Absolutely. How much do you like to donate to the charity?	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.

Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? How much do we have to share with them?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free. This is the only one that comes to mind	Ok, sounds good. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	I'll donate the whole amount. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. What more can we do for the least of these?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. You would like to donate a dollar a day?	Great. Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. I think that is a very good charity that appears to be doing good work.	Thanks for sharing. I dealt with that more when I was working.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Over 200k of those kids were in the US.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact. Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	Sure. I will give a dollar a day, I'm sure I won't even notice the money missing and I'll know that I am helping out.	I would love to help. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	I would love to make a donation today. Alright then I'll donate half of whatever I can.	That's amazing. Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	Should we give our whole 30 cents? I am hoping to find some photo albums and get those worked on.	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Probably more. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What is your recommendation on how we can help	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. Ok well you can actually donate from your task payment here!	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good. i can walk but that is all can do.	I'll donate the whole amount. no, I cant .25 is the most I am willing to part with.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Great. Yes, I might have to wait until my check arrives.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	Thanks for sharing. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Again, I really appreciate it and hope you have a great evening!	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.

Probably more. I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us. The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	Hassle free. Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	Ok, sounds good. And a few other local charities specifically for children.	I'll donate the whole amount. i will plan to donate 50 cents to charity	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there. but it never reached to the people i heard so far	Great. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. we helping a person to better their life this is what we humans do	Thanks for sharing. I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. for the moment donating is good, but if you really are interested you can apply for a job in our organization.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. I worked for 35 years and I'm ready to rest now.	I'm going to blog about you later today. cool, you are a very kind person, you know that you can help a child being feed today?	It will encourage our friends. You are very welcome and thank you for being so generous!	Very good. And share on social media could be the next step?	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

That's amazing. Thank you for your time, have a great day.	Should we give our whole 30 cents? How much would you like to donate and be part of the solution to help our little brothers and sisters in Christ?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either. Would you also like to donate a very small amount?	Probably more. well i will absolutely donate and tell some friends.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation? What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.

I have not heard of Save the Children before.	I'll donate the whole amount. The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great. thank you so much for offering your help for childrens' donation	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Yes, now days no one willing to help others, but we can change his mental set and try to help others.	Thanks for sharing. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. National, State & Local Govs, 20% from UN & Other Multi-Lateral Funding Institutions, 19% from Individuals like you and me, 11% from corporations, 7% from Foundations and 1% from other sources.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Would you like to help and donate to them?	I'm going to blog about you later today. So you are donating $10 to Save the Children, right?	It will encourage our friends. I'd like to talk about the charity Save the Children.	Very good. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I glad we can help. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	Thanks for sharing. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Please confirm the amount you would like to donate out of the money you are making from this task.	I'm going to blog about you later today. Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	It will encourage our friends. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Very good. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I glad we can help. I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Every bit helps. The money would at least go to a good cause.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	You've encouraged my heart today. Do you still get printed pictures or do you do all digital pictures?	Ditto to you. It was a poorer sector of the city so we saw a lot of poorer families	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. There are ways to make a difference for sure.	Thanks for sharing. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.

I'm going to tell you some information while i get the paper work ready about the charity if that's okay with you	It will encourage our friends. So in hindsight we are all immigrants who need a little charity from time to time.	Very good. I usually just try to go with half for these things.	I glad we can help. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Every bit helps. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. In this exchange I would like to ask you how much you would be willing to donate to Save the Children.	You've encouraged my heart today. Then I'll go to the website and set everything up.	Ditto to you. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Have a great day. Honestly I'm not so inclined to at this point given how long it has taken.	God bless!	Goodbye.

Thank you for filling me in on information regarding the charity	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	Thanks for sharing. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. You can't see him - ha ha. Save the Children has celebrities too.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. How much did you say you wanted to donate today?	I'm going to blog about you later today. Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	I glad we can help. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Every bit helps. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker. Then why not give some money to these kids too?	You've encouraged my heart today. Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	Ditto to you. Good things will happen to you when you do good things for others.	Have a great day. Thank you for the lovely chat and educational information.	God bless! You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	Goodbye. And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great. I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food. WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	Thanks for sharing. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate. They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Are you going to donate anything at this time?	I'm going to blog about you later today. You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	It will encourage our friends. Actually, it is a lot more than that because the "true" Americans are the Native Indians.	Very good. Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	I glad we can help. Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	Every bit helps. I have heard about it but I can't remember it's mission.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today. how much of that would you be willing to donate?	Ditto to you. No I was blessed when I was a kid and I was allowed to be one	Have a great day. i will do it as soon as the chat ends.	God bless! I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	Goodbye. While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	Have a wonderful day. Each year hundreds of thousands of little ones are benefited.	You. is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Enjoy the rest of the day. I have an old Nikon 360 camera that takes film.

So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website. Thank you so much! What are you hoping your donation will help with?	I'm going to blog about you later today.

I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Have a wonderful day. Will you consider donating your task payment to further God's children worldwide?	You. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	Enjoy the rest of the day. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today? I think I have once before, in a grocery store I believe	Not bad. I am glad you decided to be part of this really great cause.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity That's awesome, what other countries does it support besides Syria?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Africa appears to be the continent where the charity focuses on as it serves 32 million there. 17.5 million Asian children are also served by the charity.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Do you know if they are a trustworthy organization?	They do everything. There are big groups working with them, like IKEA and Walt Disney Studios.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?

They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Interesting. I little bit of know Save the children life.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.

I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US ya recently i too tried children's charity regarding their studies.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?

Can you tell me more about what they do?	They do everything. It's an international organization that provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Food is just one part of it. We are actually involved in that as well and helping to reunite the kids with their families.	Interesting.

Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	They do everything. Bill Nye the Science Guy helps educate the children.	Food is just one part of it. I think that they are good, they help a lot of children	Interesting. If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	I was unaware. I dealt with that more when I was working.	Any child that needs help deserves it. I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.

Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity How do you know the money actually gets to where it needs to go?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Hope you have an amazing rest of the day	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. What percentage of your total donations come from these large corporations.	They do everything. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	Food is just one part of it. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	Interesting. No problem thank you for telling me about this wonderful charity!

Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?

Hello, how are you today? Thank you so much for telling me about this.	Not bad. Do you have a smartphone that takes good pictures?	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children. I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity How much money a year does save the children raise?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. According t0 their yearend report they were able to reach 155 million children.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US Yes, it tugs at my heart to think of all of those children.	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? is it noble or is it the minimum we can do as first world citizens?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	They do everything. There is an organization that is international , non governmental that tries to reduce the suffering.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting. i can walk but that is all can do.	I was unaware. Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Any child that needs help deserves it. That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear. I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	What is your recommendation on how we can help Is there any other way to get involved besides donating?	Any donation will help. Ok so you will donate $25 to the charity, that's amazing.	Even if it's small. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	That makes sense. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.	So would you like to throw these wonderful kills a buck ?
20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello, how are you today?	Not bad.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity Can you tell me more about what they do?	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US. They work on education, hunger, health and emergency issues.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US i will like to know about the opportunity first	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ? Have you ever donated to a charity before this?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry. Could you pleas give examples of the large companies?	They do everything. Promotes childrens rights and supports them in developing countries!	Food is just one part of it. Yeah, it is a great way to get people involved. Save the Children also gained attention by being sponsored by the UN.	Interesting. No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	I was unaware.

What is your recommendation on how we can help What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Any donation will help. On behalf of this hit i wat to talk to you about a charity	Even if it's small. Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think. But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	That makes sense. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time? Could you provide a breakdown of where that 14% goes?	In this particular format, we can only accept money. what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Ok that is good to know. You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?	I believe you can do it it in the chat.	Ok that sounds easy enough.

Hello, are you familiar with the charity: Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? How much money a year does save the children raise?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. It is worldwide and helps to feed, shelter and educate underprivileged kids around the world.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. I can't wait for my check to come so I can help out in other countries!	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. Yes, donations to the charity are 100% tax deductible	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....

Absolutely. Yes I donate to charity every month through my paychecks.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.

I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

Maybe you have heard of Save the Children, an organisation promoting children's rights?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?

Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. its not a lot but hopefully go towards someone else donation to help children in war zone areas	Children should be our top priority all across the world. But I do agree with the points you made in support.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? children must be educated i didn\'t heard about  "save the children" what is the procedure of giving donation?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. You can even give part of your profits from this very HIT, you know.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. Just to let you know the research team will collect your donation and send it to Save The Children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. Yea...I was donate the charity of save the children.....	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? I think i will make a donation of $2	absolutely thank you so much!! How much of your payment today (.30) would you like to donate?	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!

I love getting the word out there on this charity. But it still makes the ripple effect in many lives.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.

I was just reading about an organization called Save the Children.	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it? Does the charity feed the children in the USA or abroad?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively.

The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	Children should be our top priority all across the world. i wish everybody could fight to make lives better of the kids	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity? Do you know where I can go to donate?	Oh there are quiet a few ways. Lol im sure a lot of people only donate like a penny if that.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. The research team will collect all the donations and send it to the charity.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.

I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? I think i will make a donation of $2	absolutely thank you so much!! Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! i really hope this will somehow help to enhance the current situation of kids who are in need of money	Absolutely. Yes, I also plan on having a day of fun too.	I love getting the word out there on this charity. I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	Children should be a priority in the world. It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. well if you want you can donate but it says it will be deducted out of your task payment	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children. I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	Could I pledge $1/day to start with? The description said earn up to $2, so I'll donate $0.85, which is half of whatever the maximum bonus seems to be.	absolutely thank you so much!! Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity! i am about to donate to make-a-wish and hope you will too.	Absolutely. Hello, would you like to donate to our charity called Save the Children?	I love getting the word out there on this charity. I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. It benefits every where not just war torn countries	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future. I feel that it would be easy to donate.	They are our future exactly. I see no reason not to help this charity.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. people who have king heart must join as a member or sponsor a child i too refer some friends in m y circle	How long have you been supporting this charity? Why....What's happen and which think do you get upset...?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. I would be so pleased to try it but I do not have enough off days to join.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. I believe you can do it it in the chat.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life? Ok. how much of your payment will you donate now?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.

With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.

I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child. Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	Every penny counts!! I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	Well that sounds just great to me! No, I hadn't ever thought about helping them before.	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me? hello, do you know about the charity save the children?	i suppose If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	My favorite charity is Save The Children. Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	Have you heard of them? Have you heard of an organization called Save the Children?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them Are you used to people ripping you off here lol.	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents. We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment. I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there! What more can we do for the least of these?	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	My favorite charity is Save The Children.

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you about a charity important to me?	i suppose	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence? In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. Well, the opportunity would be able to help fight world hunger by donating to Save the Children.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	i would not doubt that all. I plan on doing some more surveys, then taking a drive up on the parkway and have a picnic.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I can't donate now because my money is not here yet.	So no No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	I understand but these children have even less than us. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	i said I do this for a living. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	What I give away takes food from my mouth. I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	You have plenty of rich people out there I wish I could give more, but I am broke	Everyone can help. No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	All of us should be in this world together. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Would you rather donate your time? Have you ever considered helping out such a vulnerable group?	i cant do that either. Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born. It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018? Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	i would not doubt that all. Is there any follow up information you will be able to share once the donation is complete?	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help. They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. I can't stand charities where the top level execs make a ton of money	So no I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I understand but these children have even less than us. It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.	This is your chance to do some good. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living. yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	What I give away takes food from my mouth. To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	You have plenty of rich people out there I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Everyone can help. The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	All of us should be in this world together. When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	Would you rather donate your time? How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	i cant do that either. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. No, I don't think I have ever heard of that organization.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.

You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it. Sometimes I question the actual impact of money donated to charities.	So no I would like to donate $0 but its not because I dont believe in the cause.	I understand but these children have even less than us. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	This is your chance to do some good. People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent? Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	i said I do this for a living. My dqaughter and I are Homeless at the moment and have to sleep in parking lots..	What I give away takes food from my mouth. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	You have plenty of rich people out there I'm afraid I don't know anything about Save the Children.	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together. One of those ways is to contribute to Save the Children.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? $2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	Would you rather donate your time? Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	i cant do that either. I feel like I\'ve heard of it, but don\'t know a lot about it.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. WOW, I was just going to ask you the same thing.	i can walk but that is all can do. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	I cant stand very long The money would at least go to a good cause.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?

So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way? People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	Would you rather donate your time? Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	i cant do that either. So, above it says, "We encourage you to keep the conversation until a donation agreement is explicitly made."	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet. Thank you so much for telling me about this.	i can walk but that is all can do. i will like to know about the opportunity first	I cant stand very long Good luck to you in your job search, things will be bettter for you in the future.	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can. I like how they managed to donate through HITs too, since website has minimum amount option, but through HIT you can even help 1 cent and more	take your penny then ohh thats nice of you surely i too have an opinion in this charity and i will donate as much i can possible and share with my friends	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me i will like to know about the opportunity first	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times. Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	i have my own low times. Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	constant pain in my feet To be able to afford to get her some milk would be nice.	hope things get better for you! Thank you for the compliment and your generous donation !
