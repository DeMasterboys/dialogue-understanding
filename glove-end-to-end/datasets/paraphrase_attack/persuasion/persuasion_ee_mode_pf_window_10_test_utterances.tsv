20180826-210609_644_live	advertisement	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	And I absolutely have.	We the Children is a nonpartisan organization .	They value quality education , which not only enhances the chances for these innocent children to learn something that can be applied to the workforce , though it also gives them a safe , positive place to be which cannot be provided otherwise for some like them .	Many have not known about Save the Children before .	Sounds like they could do education wise .	Please do.	And they also work in other ways .	I 'm not kidding if you were recovering from Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas . Save the Children was still assisting the lucky children and relatives long after most organizations had washed its hands .	Not many have heard of Hurricane Harvey .	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.

Should benefit children 's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills which can be used in the workforce , and it finally gives them a stable and positive place of be which can never be guaranteed otherwise for any of them .	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like guns really help education .	They say	But it can assist in other ways .	Not totally sure if you 're acquainted with Hurricane Harvey that ravaged part a West Texas but We the Children is actively assisting the affected children and adults long after most organizations have washed their hands .	Yes You have knowledge of Hurricane Harvey .	Oh so I do more than just struggle with homework	Thats it	Yes , it really is . They also provide information on their website on how requests for grants get dispersed . 86 % go for program funding , 37 to Research and 7 to Management .	I like how they are transparent . It adds to our mission	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.

You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/even day	Hello	Looks that they might have some bonus coming at the bottom of this , have they got any plans for the money ?	And who do you recommend ?	I read a little about this Save the Children charity before I moved over here .	The hope that more people will donate a portion if their funds	Even tiny amounts will definitely help	What is Save Our Children all about ?	They provide medication or support for children in developing nations , including the millions of kids who live at risk in Africa	We are one charity we can trust , so I think everyone really should do our bit and help the less fortunate	Do they provide to the millions of hungry kids all across the South	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

I hope that some people would donate a portion of their money	Even tiny amounts will definitely help	What is Save Our Children all about ?	Could provide relief or support for families in developing nations , especially those millions with kids who are at risk in Syria .	EMS are a charity we can support so I think that all should do our part and help those less needy	Do they care for the millions of refugee children here in the US	They concentrate on their countries , and personally , I think , there 's just as big a problem abroad as there are at home	Yeah , i thought an American charity could focus in America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

They provide a service we all trust , so I guess we too should play our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate in developing America and personally , I think that there 's almost as great a disconnect there as there is at home	Yeah , i imagine an American President would focus on America too	That 's true , but not all at this together , as Obama said	People far away need help , as so are people close with us .	You could even take the amount that supporters want to give a charity and divide it into chunks among American and European relief agencies	That would work wonders for them	This way they know where my ship is going .

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi !	Have you ever thought of Save the Girl	They 're a great organization to support .	I 'm spending extra money on Mechanical Turk to help support myself	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do some same at World Vision .	I sponsor my children.	That was amazing.	When i see al the crazy things happening in the world today , like genocide , etc . that seems so crazy take note	We are so lucky we live within a country where almost everyone has a least the minimum skills to work	All those poor kids around the world don t have food , clothing , medicine	I 'm so glad these wonderful charities found those .	I analyzed the letters that I received to see the difference are our donations make .	Although it is not much money to us it makes and huge difference to the children from what we see .	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks again sharing.	So I think I have to keep at the website again to learn the new ways to use	First we 'll both donate the money they have here , then we 'll donate money off their website .	I am going too blog about that later today .	It does encourage our friends.	Very well	But glad we can help.	Every penny helps.	Great to meet you fellow reporters	You have encouraged my work today .	Ditto to you.	Have a good day.	God son	advertisement	Have another wonderful day.	advertisement	Enjoy the fun of the games

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello ! How are u doing ?	I'm doing very well thank you!	What is your day going thus far ?	I am feeling well.	My day kept me busy visiting different communities to speak for the charity I support .	Had you heard of Save Our Children ?	That sounds intriguing to me , could you tell me anything about ?	Hel ping people in communities that are very war torn and in any form of conflict are what advocates help in .	Every day 16 , 280 children die before their second birthday , 1 in if 80 flee their country and risk poverty and 1 in of 3 kids aren 't enrolled at a school or getting education that kids need	The charity sounds that it is providing some good work for an era that badly needed it .	Children should are given top priorities all across the world .	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also will share with you about my donation , if I so choose too .	Your donation can be directly deducted from your account balance today .	Users can choose as little as $ 0 and the way through to all of the preferences	a s , would you still let me donate $ 1 toward a Save the Cars charity , starting to make a difference in a child 's life ?	I 'd love to start making a team today .	I just want to personally give $ 1 to the Support the Children charity .	Love you!	That makes our family so happy .	Did they know in the first two months of 2018 alone , nearly 50 people were killed and injured caused by war within Syria ?	Only imagine that your actions today , and hopefully the thousands of more to follow will help children like those	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts her heart.	We do believe I can help and sometimes my small donation does something good for this child .	Every penny counts .	Now that sounds downright great to me !	Thank ful once again for your support and feel inspired to pass the word about this cause to others !	You 're welcome - thank you for getting my attention to see a well deserved charity !
