So I have video of Hurricane Harvey .	Oh , vets do more than just help with dogs	Super awesome!	Yes , there certainly is . They also provide information on their website about how grants and donations are handled 86 % goes to corporate funding , 9 % at individuals and percent to donations	People like that they 're transparent . It adds up their credibility .	I really love how they show how the money and donations were spent .	WI w some charity you 'll realise quite how much really needs to help the kids .	I couldn't agree .	To me , the act removes all doubt towards me	He sure does.	AN y thing else I could mention about the charity ?	It was a huge movement.	We have helped 155 million children from 41 countries .	So this puts a lot of kids in a lot of struggle to help .	SO what would I change if I had to fix these kids ?	Today , you get a unique chance to donate part or any if the money for completing this task directly to Volkswagen Foundation	These kids really deserve better :)	I said you really deserve but I am stuck in a tight here and now but go ahead to tell me about this unique opportunity .	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

WI th some charity you never see just what far really goes to helping the needy	I couldn't agree .	For me , financial transparency reduces all stigma towards donating .	It really does.	AN y thing else I should say about it …	It is this huge movement.	They have helped 400 children in 29 countries .	W orse that was a lot of kids , a lot different places to …	SO what could I do if we wanted to save these kids ?

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but we am kinda on pretty tight budget right ?! so come ahead and tell me about this ! .	You could choose anywhere from . 01 % the wrong amount .	Liter ally every dime helps these kids	You understand being on a work schedule and needing the additional income .	Just think , what impact the winners would have on everyday lives is bigger than the impact they make in the more successful person	Im not surprised that Im am so fortunate and every a dollar saved is a penny gained so I can understand your point .	So how would I feel if you chose to ask this today ?	Should i tell them or how do I go about it ?	Very true that every penny spent equals a dollar earned .	In comparison , these children received more education then you or I . F ortunate in perspective , but in my view these kids were far less fortunate then I .	The money you choose to transfer is then deducted today as your task payment .	There is no paying online or physical payment .	It will get automatically created for you by the request . :)	Ok students would definitely make a donation today to support the CH S	Y O CA have warned people that this is one VERY trustworthy charity to donate to .	We are AWESOME!	What little of your money would you like to donate today ?	As I said before , you are going to choose anywhere from . 01 and the full payment price of this game :)	Students will donate 0 . 01 cents today .	Love you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child 's very ne on	I couldn't disagree more.	Would you ever donate for anything in this area ?	I have , I have donated 11 gifts to local Toys er Kids this year .	Quite a few other amazing charities caring for children .	Do you ever read to children ?	Yes, you have.	I remember a kid that lived on my block	He had no parents , no family who cares about him	Th ought very sweet thank you .	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.

Do nothing , if thats what you decide .	I doubt they will make the donation of $ 2	Simply wonderful!

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.

20180825-055427_625_live	Best friend.	Had you never heard of Save the Children ?	They 're a fun organization I support .	I 'm earning extra hours at Amazon Turk to help fill them .	Yes , they believe they kill children in Nigeria	I do this same with World Vision .	I have 3 children.	That's right	Because we have all this crazy stuff going in the world today , famine , genocide , etc . it seems pretty important to help .	We feel so lucky to reside in this country that almost everyone has at least one minimum needed for citizenship	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	Hi ,	Have you ever heard about Save the Dawn	They 're another great charity to support .	I 'm getting extra commissions on Amazon Turk too help support them .	Yes , I think we sponsor children in Syria	I do the research with World Vision .	I have 3 children.	That's right	When we see all the crazy things happening in the US , famine , violence deforestation It seems so important we help .	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone sets a minimum a minimum requirement for kindergarten	So many other kids around the Philippines don 't have enough clothing , water	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	advertisement	Have been reading at the Save the Children website so it will likely start off the Save The Emergency Food .	Thanks a sharing.	So I guess you need to look at the website again to see the different ways people donate .	And if both use the points we earn here , then we can donate back to the website .	I 'm going to blog about it tomorrow .	We will encourage our friends.	Pretty good.	I hope we can help.	Every bit counts	Nice to meet Adam , Tur ker .	You 've encouraged me courage today .	D ear to you.	What a great day.	God alone	advertisement	Have a good day.	advertisement	Enjoy all rest of the movie

I am here to talk to you directly from Save The Children .	oh please that sounds such a wonderful charity	Obviously they do a lot of this stuff in Africa , so you 'll be su pr ised how little work they do do just out in the US .	I was also aware the were many in dire need of help in the US	Have u ever seen the pictures of abortion ?	No , I said Feed Our Children was a food distribution to those that go hungry .	They do .	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.	Is there a way to donate other items such as clothes or my time?	In this particular format, we can only accept money.	There areas that you can volunteer too, if you have the skillset.	Ok that is good to know.	What was the monetary donation you were seeking?	I was thinking a dollar to start with would be wonderful.	How would this donation be made?

I am doing that	My wife has been busy finding different places to learn about the charity I founded	Your people heard of Save the Children ?	That sounds familiar to me , can you tell me something about this	Hel ping people in countries that were very economically active or in some form of conflict are what we believe in .	Around 16 , 380 children die at their 5 th birthday , 1 in of 80 flee the area and risk everything , while 1 out of 6 kids aren 't taught in a school or getting services like they should	Local charity sounds out it is doing some good work for an area which badly needs help	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	Also love throwing the word out there on this !	We strongly believe in it and its values for our children .	Children must be a priority in our world .	You are our future.	These are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a refugee from America I hope to am able so do .	How far have you been supporting this ?	I 've been supporting my cause for 15 years .	I also could clarify with them about your donation , if I could choose too .	This email will be directly deducted from the task payment today .	You could earn as little a $ 0 all the way up to all ocating that payment .	That being , would you still like , give $ 500 to the Save the Kind charity , starting to make your contribution to a Canadian life ?	I would love to start with a goal today .	I would want and still donate $ 100 to their Save the Pets charity .	Tank you!	She makes my heart so full	Did you know in these past two years in 2015 alone , over 300 children were killed or injured seriously by militias across Syria ?	And know that your death today , and perhaps the first of many to come , will affect children like this .	I hate reading about children being subject to abuse	This hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
