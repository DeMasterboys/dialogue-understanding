20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	* Have you ever donated towards a children 's charity before ?	Yes, they absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I only hope that they structure where the funding and donations are spent .	WI th every charity you never realize quite how much really goes to help one individual	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	m not sure if I am very fortunate in that a coin saved is a penny earned , but I cant see your point .	But how would I feel if I chose to use this today ?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I hope you have a WONDERFUL rest of your day!!

I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.	Thank you :)	You are awesome for giving your hard earned money to these kids :)	I pray you have a W ON DER FUL END of the year
20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.

It is an international organization which provides education , health and safety to all children .	Oh, that's great!	What sort of assistance do they offer specifically?	They currently have an initiative to assist children at the Mexican/American border.	They also recently aided children impacted by flooding in Japan.	Wow, they really help people all around the world.	Are you at all associated with Save the Children?	I've been a donor and advocate for years.	It's really easy to get involved.	Oh, really?	What's the best way to get involved in your opinion?	Considering the monumental need, there is always a need for funding. Even small donations have a huge impact.	Do you know where I can go to donate?	The research team here can transfer a donation for you.	That'd be fantastic!	Do you know where Save the Children mainly operates out of?	The main headquarters is in Fairfield, CT, and there is also office in Washington DC.	They actually have an office near me then.	I'd love to visit one of their facilities.	I'm not sure if they do tours, but you can check out their contact info at  URL	There is a lot of info about the organization there.	Oh, that's unfortunate, but I'll definitely check out all the information on their website.	Excellent!	Would you like to donation a portion of your task payment today to get the ball rolling?	I would definitely like to make a donation!	Great!	How much would you like to contribute?	You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll gladly give all of my payment.

Why not give what you were going to give to St Jude to Save the Children?	0k Here is a .25	Couldn't you split it 50/50? Give them $1? I mean you'd give that to St Jude wouldn't you?	I would ifd my daughter was not needing milk also…	Its hard to donate when I feel i would be taking from my daughter to give to other children..	This isn\'t money you\'ve even seen yet though.	It\'s "imaginary" money until it materializes so that\'s different?	I\'m sure you could give $2	Its not imaginary money though... what i give takes away from ours later.	Well think of all the money you spend on things you don't need?	$2 is definitely money we waste daily and that would really help these kids.	No, I do not waste any money, Right now school is about to start and she has no school supplys or anything new for school.	shoot i am the biggest tight wad when it comes to trying to save anything for her.	Then why not give some money to these kids too?	They have even less than your daughter has.	You can surely spare $2	but I cant . 25 be the most yr am willing to part .	How much do you like to contribute to the charity now ?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).	>15 cents sorry maybe more next time.
20180903-103939_512_live	Save the Children is a great charity you should consider donating to	yeah , i agree it is a great charity, but i prefer to donate to St Jude	I think that's great too but if you already give to St Jude why not give to Save the Children this time?	I guess I could throw them .10	Why not give them more so they can really help the children with it?	I am so broke but giving a dime is really all i can afford today.	It wouldn't hurt to give more.	Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.	You know they're worse off than you, right?	Honestly < do not think so.

20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	I cannot agree more.	Had you ever applied for projects in your area ?	I have, I have donated christmas gifts to local Toys for Tots every year.	And a few other local charities specifically for children.	Have you ever donated to children?	Yes, I have.	I remember a kid that lives on the streets.	He has no parents ,no one that cares about him	Thats very sweet of you.	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.	If I had the money that some people have, I would form my own foundation specifically for under privileged children and those in need.	I think you can still make a difference.	How much money do you waste on candy or cookies every year?	I don't waste much money on that type of stuff.	My money is more wasted on drive thru getting coffee.	I can easily cut down on that to donate more to charity tho.	Great idea!!	Thank for helping to the cause.	If we all donate a little to Save the children we will have less hunger in the world.	Everyone should be responsible of this issue	I agree.	Children are the future, and not only that, but they didn't ask to be born, so why should they suffer?	They need the best shot and thats up to us to give.	Exactly!!!.	I hope more people think like you and me	If that was the case, than we might not be in this problem.	But we can always try.	We should start increasin our contribution to Save the children program and make consciousness for other people to join as well	I agree.	What do you have in mind?	tell to family and friends is a first step	And share on social media could be the next step?

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	advertisement	Sounds like there might have a bonus coming at the end of this to give you any other plans for the summer	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How often do readers like to donate to the museum now ?	The researchers will prefer you donate anything comparable to half amount of the prize task payment .	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.

20180825-043516_619_live	Hi, I hope you are well today!	Hello am how were you doing ?	advertisement	I'm getting ready to spend the day volunteering for my favorite charity!	Yes, so I think it is a good idea to donate to the childrens charity.	Same here!	I am volunteering for the charity called Save the Children.	Are you familiar with them?	No I am not.	Can you tell me about it?	They promote children's rights and help support kids in developing countries.	It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.	What can I do to help?	I'm so glad you asked!	One thing you could do is agree to contribute what you make just from this one task we are doing right now.	Ok how much do you need?	If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!	Isn't that amazing?	That is awesome but I need the money so I can't afford to give right now.	I know what you mean, I need to make money too.	But at the same time, here we are in front of our computers, and we can work all day to make up the small amount we will contribute.	I can't work all day.	I have to take care of my disable family member and I really can't afford it.	Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.	I have problems too.	But as little as $1 can feed a child for the whole day.	I don't know about you, but I could find $1 in change just lying around the house.	No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.	Believe it or not, 10 cents makes a difference in a child's life!	Wonderful.	I am so happy I can help.	Thank you again.	If you would like to learn more about Save the Children, check out their website.	Have an awesome day and thank you again!	What is the website for Save the Children?	The web address is  URL

No matter how big our problems are, we are not going to starve for lack of a dollar...	I have 10 cents I can give.	That's awesome and generous!	Thank you for doing this.	I will also give money today.

20180825-081859_875_live	Hello!	Are you part of We the Children organization ?	I have a fairly rudimentary notebook	I think it has to do with helping sick children.	Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization.	It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.	That is a great cause.	However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first.	Especially animal organizations.	While it is true that relief is also needed domestically.	The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.	Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.	that is true.	I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss.	How do you feel about animal charities?	This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children.	Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement.	Small donations really do add up and make a difference.	Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.	That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations.	So you charity of choice is Save the Children?	Or do you donate to other ones also?	My charity of choice is Save the Children.	I strongly identify with their causes and goals.	Do you donate money only?	Or do you also volunteer your time?	I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.	You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.	I would be willing to donate 10 cents.	I make large donations every year so my budget is limited.	But I do agree with the points you made in support.	Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?	I appreciate your help in supporting this cause.	I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money.	I believe it would be a valuable experience.	What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?	My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group.	They save miniture IG dogs.	I adopted one years ago and she is the best.	But children's charities are great too.	Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?	That is great!	Animal charities are pretty great too!	And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.	Celebrities often get involved and donate time.	It's really cool.	I think Disney World participates too.	That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved.	Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions.	For sure.	It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit.	Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.	I definitely agree with all those points.	Their support can make the difference between making a charity reach its goals or not.	Helping others is necessary and makes you feel good too.

20180825-080131_220_live	Hello there!	Have you heard of the international organization Save the Children?	Hi.	It sounds familiar but I'm not sure.	Save the Children is a non-governmental organizaton that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.	It's a great organization!	Is it reputable?	Certainly!	I do volunteer work that supports the organization, actually.	And if you'd like to check out the website, you can go to  URL	It looks like they do great work.	Let's make a donation.	Sounds great, your generosity will go great lengths!	How much would you like to donate to the organization?	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment and you can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.	I'll donate half my payment, so $.15.	Wonderful!	The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children.	Sounds good.	Out of curiosity, what did you do as a volunteer?	Pack educational materials/books to send to children with limited access to such resources	That's interesting.	I might want to volunteer too.	It's a very rewarding experience.	A productive activity to fill your free time with.	:)	It doesn't seem fair that some kids are born into bad situations through no fault of their own.	Certainly.	The good thing is, however, that there are many organizations that we can support that help push for and ensure the rights of children and that they are given opportunities to succeed.	Thanks for telling me about it.	You are welcome!	Thank you for your kind donation.	It's not much, but I don't have much money.	Of course I have no way of knowing no matter what you answer, but are you a real person?	Small changes lead to big results.	;) and haha!	Yes, I am. :)	Good luck to all	I doubt you make lots of donations .

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever thought of Protect the Children ?	They 're a terrific charity I think	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started working after college , hoping an extra few hours a week was a way to give , and now that 's moved on in my career and I , glad I 'm able to give more .	Plus , Save the Children is really poorly rated on Freedom Report	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.

I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	Anyone want to join me?	It must be much ; every penny matters	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

For all the negativity on the news , I 'm happy to know there are some great people out here	advertisement	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	advertisement	Have begun eyeing up the Save the Day website so I will likely buy off the catalog , like Wise Food .

20180808-081317_142_live	Hello new friend!	Hello , how are things ?	My bad.	I'm here to talk to you today about Save The Children.	Ok, please explain, sounds like a wonderful charity	Well they do a lot of good work in Africa, but you might be suprised how much work they actually do right here in the US.	I was not aware there were many children in need of help in the US	Have you ever seen the rate of illiteracy ?	No, I thought Save The Children was about food distribution to those that are hungry.	They do everything.	Food is just one part of it.	Interesting.	I was unaware.	Any child that needs help deserves it.	That's exactly the philosophy I like to hear.	What is your recommendation on how we can help	Any donation will help.	Even if it's small.	Economies of scale actually make it so a donation becomes much more than one would think.	That makes sense.

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I 'm doing very well today goodness	how 's your day going so far ?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Please know , your donation today , and hopefully the rest of those that come , will help organizations like this .	I hated hearing about children be subjected to abuse	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

20180825-053711_81_live	Hi there!	Can I tell you of a work important to you	i Stock	My favorite charity is Save The Children.	Have you heard of them?	is this crowdfunding, yes i have heard of them	Well hopefully I can convince you to donate to them..even if it's just 25 cents.	They make sure children have access to health resources, education and a safe environment.	Can you imagine living in extreme violence?	if they are so important what about the killing of babies thru abortion.	That's a serious issue too, but this charity focuses on children that have been born.	Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?	i would not doubt that all.	sorry i have too keep my money, i am very poor man	what is great about this donation is you can donate a portion of your earnings from this conversation...any little bit will help.	this is my full time job and i depend on every penny from it.	So no	I understand but these children have even less than us.	This is your chance to do some good.	Can you try to even donate 1 cent?	i said I do this for a living.	What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your penny then	are there any charities that you favor?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!

What I give away takes food from my mouth.	You have plenty of rich people out there	Everyone can help.	All of us should be in this world together.	I agree that rich people have more to give, but can't those of us with very little also help in a way?	Would you rather donate your time?	i cant do that either.	I am semi-crippled with very bad feet.	i can walk but that is all can do.	I cant stand very long	I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.	I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.	I feel like I do some good by even just being willing to give a penny when I can.	take your time then	are there specific charities that authors favor ?	save the children but hurt me	I think you can help Save the Children but also help yourself by knowing you are helping others, even during your low times.	i have my own low times.	constant pain in my feet	hope things get better for you!
