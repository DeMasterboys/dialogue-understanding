They value children 's education greatly which not just enhances an opportunity for these early children to develop skills that can directly applied in the workforce , however it also gives them a safe and independent place to be that can 't be guaranteed otherwise for all of them .	I had not heard of Save Some Turtles before .	Sounds awful they 'd help education wise .	I do.	And they also assist in unexpected ways .	I 'm not sure whether you were unhappy with the Ike that devastated part East Downtown Houston but Save the Children is still feeding the affected children and families long after many organizations have washed their hands .	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?

You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I.

Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?

Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent.

20180826-053811_708_live	A donation for a child is very neccesary	We couldn't agree more.	Have you ever donate to causes in this area ?	I know I have donated the presents to benefit Toys for T ots This year .	And certainly few other local organizations specifically help children .	Have you ever pulled towards children ?	Yes, they have.	We have a kid that lives on the street	He has no one , no one that knows about him	So very kind of you .	What did you get him?	I get in touch with the Save the Children program.	They get him a house and warm food	Thats amazing.	I am glad you were there to help him.	I would do the same	It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need	Its extremely sad.

20180826-180300_663_live	Good afternoon/evening	Hello	Looks like there might be a bonus coming at the end of this HIT, have you got any plans for the money?	Nope, what do you recommend?	I read a lot about the Save the Children charity before I came in here.	I hope that more people will donate a portion of their income.	Even small amounts will definitely help	What's Save the Children all about?	They provide relief and support to children in developing nations, especially the millions of kids who are at risk in Syria.	They are a charity we can trust, so I think we all should do our part to help the less fortunate	Do they provide for the millions of hungry kids here in the USA?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!

Or else and that is what you decide .	I decided i 'll make the donation of $ 2	How wonderful!	I realized I 'm getting eager to improve whatever happens next with the research and regression models so I talk about a move on .	It 's great speaking with you .	And thanks for reading	That sounds wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great talking to you .

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Had you ever heard of Save Our Children ?	They are a great charity I think	I 'm earning extra money on Canadian Prime to help manage them .	Yes , we know they sponsor children in Afghanistan	I do that same for Clear Vision .	I sponsor 3 teams	That's why	As I see all the ugly things happening around the world today , like genocide , everything this seems so important to help .	English are very lucky to be in a society where almost everyone earns at least the minimum needed to survival .	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.
20180825-055427_625_live	best friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	What a great charity I support .	I 'm earning some commissions on Amazon Turk to help with them .	But I think they sponsor children with need .	I think the same for Every Vision .	Help sponsor 3 children.	Pretty amazing.	As you see of the crazy things associated with the US today , the genocide , etc . it seems so difficult to help .	People are so lucky to live under a country that almost everyone has at most the minimum chance to survival .	Too many poor kids in this world don 't have enough clothing , shelter .

They are so lucky to live outside a country that almost everybody has the least the basics needed for survival .	How many little kids around our world dont have food , clothing , shelter .	So really glad these great charities help those kids .	I appreciate the letters which we receive and see the impact that our donations have	Although it is not huge difference to us its makes making huge difference for the children from what I have .	How long have you lived ?	For Forbes	I started back in 1996 and an extra few dollars a year was a lot to handle and now that having moved on to my careers and studies I 'm thankful I was able to move more .	Plus , Save American Children is really poorly rated on Judicial Watch .	I know some groups spend 75 percent in donations , then gathering more money and administration etc .	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	We just read they are going to be helping survivors of the Hurricane hit Haiti	That was good.	We heard good things from Save the Water	We believe his brother sponsors a kid with them .	I believe Vision Vision is viewed highly and well .	Im sure these people can help others in need and I have been blessed a bit to help others .	Advertisement	We 're blessed to be a family proves what I said	Tell 're what , you 've encouraged me .	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be that blessing , is all I say	You know what , probably encouraged :	They think I 'm I will donate the money I earn today to Bless Our Children .	You want to help me?	It may cost much but every penny matters	We can still do much with 30 troops but on another country that could be the big difference	advertisement	We would love to help.	I would like to make a donation .	That is amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It 's not like any of us can worry much about it either .	Read more.	Do I stand by the catalog / general donation ?	I read that the people sponsoring the research project are PAC money , and at this moment we have no option of just allowing them to keep our income and direct it to Support the Children instead of paying out to us .	H arm free.	Which sounds good.	I 'll donate that whole thing	And just glad I got to with you .	With all the negativity in this world just glad to know there are some great people out .	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.

Labor free.	That sounds good.	I 'd donate the full amount .	I 'm actually glad we 've partnered with you .

Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I am doing very good thank you !	How is your app going so far ?	I 'm doing well.	My day has been busy to different places and learn about the charity we support .	Have your heard of Free the Children ?	It looks familiar to me , could someone show me more of it ?	Hel pless children in areas that are very war torn or in any form such conflict are something we help in .	Every day 16 , 000 children dies before their first birthday , 1 out of 80 flee the area and lose everything , only 1 out of 6 people aren is enrolled at a school or getting education that most need	China EU sounds like it is getting some good work in the area that badly needs support	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	We love getting the word out there about the charity .	I strongly believe from it and its values of helping others	Children should be a minority in the government	Children are our future.	They know our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a life for a person in poverty I hope to be used to accomplish that	How long 've you been supporting the charity ?	We have been supporting this charity for ages .	I surely must clarify with you about the donation , should you so choose .	Your donation should be automatically deducted against your task payment today .	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said , can everyone please choose to donate $ 1 to our Feed the Children charity , dedicated to making a difference in a child s lives	I 'd like too start making a difference .	I would like to personally donate $ 20 toward the Save the Children charity .	Love you!	That makes my heart feel heavy	Did you know in the first eight months of 2016 alone , over 80 children was murdered or injured permanently by violence in Russia	Just remember that your donation today , and with the millions of donations that come , will help children in this .	I like hearing about children becoming subject to violence .	It broke my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!
