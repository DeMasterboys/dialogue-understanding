20180826-210609_644_live	advertisement	Hi , Have you all been to any children s charity before ?	Yeah I absolutely have.	Power 4 Children is a great organization .	They influence children 's education greatly because not only enhances their ability for very innocent children and learn things that can be applied into the workforce , but also really gives them a safe and positive place to be which can 't be experienced otherwise for some of them .	I have not heard of the the Queen .	Sounds if they really help education .	I do.	But they also assist by unexpected ways .	Not very sure if you are familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Carolina but We the Children are still assisting the affected children & teens long after other organizations have dried their hands .	Yes I have pictures of Bobby Harvey .	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility.	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.	There's no paying online or entering payment info.	It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)	Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.	YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.	You are AWESOME!	How much of your payment would you like to donate today?	As I said before, you are free to choose anywhere between .01 and the full payment amount for the task :)	I will donate 0.05 cents today.

Save Our Children is a great charity	I value children 's education , which not only enhances the opportunity for these innocent souls to learn skills that can be applicable to the workplace but it also offers children a safe , positive place to be which can 't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them .	We have not learned of Save the Children .	Looks like they really help education .	We do.	But they also happened in other ways .	I am not sorry if you 're acquainted with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas . Love Our Kids is still assisting the affected children and neighbors long before most organizations had washed their hands .	Yes we have heard of the Harvey .	Oh and they do better than just help with problems	Thats it	Yes , not really . They do provide information on the website about how funds for donations are dispersed . 86 % go to Annual funding , 25 to Fund raising , 5 % to Management .	We like that they are transparent . This adds towards their credibility .	I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.	WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.	I couldn't agree more.	For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating.	It sure does.	ANything else I should know about this charity?	It is a huge movement.	They have helped 155million children in 120 countries.	WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.	SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?	Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!!	These kids really deserve it :)	I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.	You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount.	Literally every penny helps these children.	I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income.	Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation.	Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.	So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?	Do i pay online or how do I go about it?	Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned.	In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

20180826-210609_644_live	Hello!	Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?	Yes, I absolutely have.	Save the Children is a great organization.	They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.	I have not heard of Save the Children before.	Sounds like they really help education wise.	They do.	But they also assist in other ways.	I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands.	Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.	Oh so they do more than just help with education.	Thats awesome!	Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management.	I like that they are transparent.

You could choose anywhere from . 23 to the actual amount .	And every dollar helps these children .	I understand being in a tight schedule , needing the additional income .	Just think , the impact the money could have on our lives was greater than the influence penn les make on a more fortunate situation .	Im nt sure that I am so fortunate if every single second invested is a penny saved though I do see your point .	So how would you donate if I chose not do so today ?	Do you pay online or how do you go about payment	Very strongly that every dollar saved represents a penny earned .	In reality my children need more guidance then you or I . This is perspective , but in my perspective , these kids are far less fortunate by most	The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment.

So what do you expect	I read a little about the Free the Children charity since I came in .	I hope maybe some people would donate a portion of their income .	These small amounts will definitely help	What 's with the Children all ?	We refuse relief or support to people in developing nations , especially the millions of children who are at war in Syria .	We are a charity we can support and I think we all should do us part and help the more fortunate	Do you listen to the millions of hungry kids here across the USA ?	They concentrate on developing countries, but, personally, I think that there is just as great a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah, i think an American charity should focus on America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.	People far away need help just as much as people close to us.	You could even take the money that you want to give to charity and split it in half among American and international relief agencies	That would work best for me.	That way i know where my money is going.	Is there a minimum to donate?	No, there is no minimum that I've ever heard of.	They know that any small amount can help.	That's great!	Is there a website where i can donate?	I'm glad to hear it!	Save the Children do have a website at  URL	You can learn more about them there, but there's an easier way to donate	What is the easier way?	The researchers behind this HIT are gathering up donations so that they can give the money to the charity all at once.	The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.	It must save time and transaction fees for the charity that way.	That's interesting and sounds good, right?	Yeah, it does sound good.	Of course it's your decision, in the end.	I am kind of curious about the details though.	How much do you like to donate to the charity now?	The researchers will let you donate anything up to the amount of your total task payment.	Or nothing, if that's what you decide.	I think i will make a donation of $2	That's wonderful!	I think I'm getting eager to see what happens next with the research and the charity, so I'm about to move on.	It was great chatting with you.	And thanks for helping!	That's wonderful!

So what do you ?	I read so lot about the Save the Children philosophy before I came here .	I hope that some people will donate a portion with their checks	Even tiny amounts will definitely help	What 's Save Our Children really about ?	We provide healthcare and aid to children from developing nations , especially to mothers of kids who are at risk in Syria .	They are a people we can trust , so I believe as humans should do our part to help those least fortunate	Do you provide for that many more hungry kids here in the USA ?	They concentrate on poor countries , but , personally , I know that there 's just so much of need abroad as there is back home	Yeah , you think an American charity better focus in America too	That's true, but we're all in this together, as they say.

Just read a bit on the Save My Children charity before I came in here .	I believe that more people will donate a portion if their money	Even small amounts will definitely impact	What 's Free the Children really about ?	They provide education and support to children in developing economies especially in support of kids who remain at risk from Syria .	We 're a network we all trust , so I think we all should do some part to help those less fortunate	Do you provide for the millions more poor children here in the USA ?	They concentrate on African countries , but , frankly we believe that assistance is almost as big a need abroad as there is at home	Yeah , i said every American charity should focus on America .	So true , but we are all in this — as they say .	People far away need CPR just as too are people close to home	You could perhaps divide the money that we want to send to Haiti and split it in halves among American and Canadian relief agencies	That would be best for you	That way i know where my money is going.

They 're a charity everyone can support so I think we all should do our bit to assist the least fortunate	How they provide for the treatment of hungry children here in the US	They rely on seven countries , globally and I think travel there is just as great a challenge abroad as it is at home	Yeah , i figured an American charity would be on America too	That 's true , just not all in this world as they say .	People further away need them just so much as people close to home	They could even take any amount that you want to donate to charity and split it in half with American or Caribbean relief agencies	That would work well for women	That way people know how my life is going .

20180825-055427_625_live	Best friend.	Had you ever heard of Save the Kids	What a great charity to support .	I 'm sending extra money through Amazon Turk to further support them .	and they believe they sponsor children with need .	I do do same for World Com	Please sponsor 3 children.	That's all	When you consider the the horrible things happening in the world today , like genocide , then it is so important to stop	People are so lucky to be in a country where not everyone has at all the basic requirements for survival .	So many immigrant kids around the US don 't have food , only shoes	I 'm so grateful the local charities help those kids .	I appreciate the letters because I get to see their impact that our children make .	Although it changes very much change for us its makes makes huge difference to the children from what I understand .	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for sharing.	Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.	So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.	I'm going to blog about you later today.	It will encourage our friends.	Very good.	I glad we can help.	Every bit helps.	Nice to meet you fellow Turker.	You've encouraged my heart today.	Ditto to you.	Have a great day.	God bless!	Goodbye.	Have a wonderful day.	You.	Enjoy the rest of the day.

20180825-055427_625_live	Hi friend.	Have you ever heard of Save the Children?	They're a great charity I support.	I'm earning extra money on Amazon Turk to help support them.	Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.	I do the same for World Vision.	I sponsor 3 children.	That's amazing.	When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.	We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.	So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.	I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.	I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.	Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.	How long have you been donating?	For years.	I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more.	Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.	You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.	Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.	I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.	That is good.	I've heard good things about Save the Children.	I think my brother sponsors a kid with them.	I believe World Vision is rated highly as well.	I'm glad that I can help others in need since I've been blessed a bit to help others.	Absolutely.	We are blessed to be a blessing, that's what I believe.	You know what, you've encouraged me.	I think I'm going to donate the money I earn today to Save the Children.	You want to join me?	It won't be much but every penny counts.	We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.	Sure.	I would love to help.	I would love to make a donation today.	That's amazing.	Should we give our whole 30 cents?	It's not like either of us can do much with that either.	Probably more.	Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?	I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.	Hassle free.	Ok, sounds good.	I'll donate the whole amount.	I'm so glad I got partnered with you.	With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.	Great.	I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.	Thanks for reading	So I hope I did the start at the website again and see any new ways to donate .	If we can just donate the money you made here , then we can make extra off the website .	Without going on blog about you again today .	It helps encourage our friends.	Very different	So glad we can help.	Every bit !	Nice to see you fellow Tur rans	You 've encouraged my pursuits .	Ditto for you.	Have a great weekend	God bless!	Good Luck	Have rather wonderful day.	advertisement	Plan the rest of your day .

20180723-052203_936_live	· What are you doing today ?	I am doing very well without you !	How is the day being so far ?	I am very well.	Every day have been busy visiting different places to speak about a charity we support .	Have you heard ? Save the kids	It sounds familiar to you can you give us more about it ?	Hel ping children in countries which are very strife torn or in some cases in conflict is something they help in .	Every day 200 children die before book time , 1 in of 80 leave the country and risk everything , and 1 out of 6 kids aren 't enrolled for a school or health care that they need	The charity sounds like it 's tackling some important work in the area that badly needs love	Children should remain the top priorities all across the world .	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too.	Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today.	You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment.	That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?	I would like to start making a difference today.	I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.	Thank you!	That makes my heart so happy.	Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?	Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.	I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence.	It hurts my heart.	I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.	Every penny counts!!	Well that sounds just great to me!	Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!	You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!	I will spread the word!

For roughly one dollar a day you can sponsor a child , you could choose the gift and donate to a child in our catalog , seniors could start the group or students can just simply donate .

20180723-052203_936_live	Hello! How are you doing today?	I'm doing very well thank you!	How is your day going so far?	I am doing well.	My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support.	Have you heard of Save the Children?	It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?	Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in.	Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need	The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it.	Children should be our top priority all across the world.	How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?	Oh there are quiet a few ways.	For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate.	With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general.	Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.	I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity.	Could I pledge $1/day to start with?	absolutely thank you so much!!	I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!	Absolutely.	I love getting the word out there on this charity.	I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children.	Children should be a priority in the world.	They are our future.	They are our future exactly.	Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so.	How long have you been supporting this charity?	I have been supporting this charity for 15 years.	I too must communicate with everyone regarding your donation , if you so choose too .	Your donation would be directly available from our task payment today .	People can choose as little at $ 10 all your way up through all of your payment .	Without being mentioned would u still like ta donate $ 1 to the Save Our Children charity , when it make a change in a child s lives	I would like your begin making a game today .	We would want but still donate $ 1 to the Change the World charity .	Thank ful	That makes my mother awfully happy .	Did you see in the last two months in 2018 alone , over 250 children were killed and wounded either by airstrikes in Syria ?	Just imagine – your donations , and hopefully the hundreds of donations to come , will help children like this .	I found images of children being subjected to violence .	It hurts her heart.	I just hope I can help and realize a small donation does some good to any child .	Every penny counts .	Well it sounds pretty great to me !	Thank you once more for your support and feel free and spread the word about the project here :	You are welcome and thanks you for bringing my company on such a well presented opportunity	I will spread the word!
