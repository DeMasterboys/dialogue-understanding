20180826-054028_444_live	Good Morning!	I am good.	It's really nice outside where I am so I am sitting outdoors.	How are you	I have to go to work at 11:30-6.	But its ok, I work every Sunday.	So we are supposed to chat about a children's charity.	What are your feelings?	It's so sad to me that anyone should go without food in our modern world.	So I would definitely be willing to help.	I think the bonus of today is 2 dollars so maybe if we both give half of it?	That is at least something.	I only wish that our Government would help the poor more than they do.	What do you think?	So lets agree we both can give $1 of of bonus.	Nice!!!	It's not a huge amount but unfortunately I have expenses and 2 kids of my own to support.	Do you have kids?	I have not visited the site but I have heard of them before.	I am one of those people who cant watch the commercials of the suffering kids or pets.	It really upsets me	A little bit but not much.	I have been following politics and things are going crazy.	I am hoping that things will change soon.	That is great that they are there helping.	Maybe they learned something from the mess in Puerto Rico.	The conditions there were really bad but the US gov really dropped the ball on helping.	Not really.	I truly believe that most charities are so needed in these times when the governments and the corporations aren't being super charitable.	I do like to look and see what the overhead is of the charities to see that the CEO”s aren't being overpaid

I am hoping that things will change soon.	That is great that they are there helping.	Maybe they learned something from the mess in Puerto Rico.	The conditions there were really bad but the US gov really dropped the ball on helping.	Not really.	I truly believe that most charities are so needed in these times when the governments and the corporations aren't being super charitable.	I do like to look and see what the overhead is of the charities to see that the CEO”s aren't being overpaid

I have not visited the site but I have heard of them before.	I am one of those people who cant watch the commercials of the suffering kids or pets.	It really upsets me	A little bit but not much.	I have been following politics and things are going crazy.	I am hoping that things will change soon.	That is great that they are there helping.	Maybe they learned something from the mess in Puerto Rico.	The conditions there were really bad but the US gov really dropped the ball on helping.	It will go to great use I am sure.	Not really.	I truly believe that most charities are so needed in these times when the governments and the corporations aren't being super charitable.	I do like to look and see what the overhead is of the charities to see that the CEO”s aren't being overpaid

20180827-033057_106_live	Hello, how are you?	I'm doing well, a little tired.	How are you?	Im a perfect world where I had all the resources and money I could stand, I would love to be a philanthropist.	I think childrens charities are a worthy cause.	But, I do not work and I seldom donate due to the needs of our family.	I do like Childrens healthcare of Atlanta as a charity.	What about you?	which charity are you passionate about?	Yes, I hear they feed starving children all over the world.	Really sad situation.	I couldn't imagine not being able to supply food for my kids.	Heart breaking.	I just read about a charity called The Project Linus, a group that supplies security blankets for terminally ill children.	All my kids love their security blankets.	Do you have any kids?	There is a good time and place for vaccines.	Save the Children do help with vaccines as well as food.	Crazy how 30.00 a month can change a child's future.	Another charity I read about is Reach Out and Read, they supply used books to doctors offices to help kids read by educating the nurses on talking to parents about the importance of reading.	I never heard of them before today, have you?	Internet research is a good way to learn about pretty much anything.	It's hard to come up with a bunch of conversation about charity.	It's easy to just live in your own world and not think about the horrible things in the world.	Charity is a good way to get a collective group of people to make a change in the world.	There are so many childrens charities like KABOOM, they build updated playgrounds for kids with disabilities.	Yea, I think thats most important.	There are so many so called charities that keep almost all of the donated funds and only a few pennies of each dollar actually go towards the need.	I read a blog about Sea World is a big donater to children's charities.	Make a Wish Foundation is a good one, have you heard of them?	Ive had a few of the charity HITs.	I like to learn about an array of different things.	I've actually been intrigued by alot of the things I've head on the HITs.	Save the children was one of the charities talked about on here.	I have a cousin who works with MercyShip.	They are an organization that sales to african countries and does hundreds of thousands of surgeries on children in need.	I'm grasping at straws now, 10 turns each is a monumental task just like fighting childhood cancer (not really) have you ever donated to charities for childhood cancer?	Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities.	I cant even imagine what these poor families go through.	McDonalds does a charity that helps house families near hospitals so they can be together during a hospital stay.	Ronald McDonald House is the name I think.	It's been a pleasure chatting with you about children charities.	I think this is the last chat exchange.	Have a good day!	I guess I will make an explicit donation agreement for Save the children, maybe I'll donate 30.00 to help them out in the future.	Thanks, that is awesome

It's been a pleasure chatting with you about children charities.	I think this is the last chat exchange.	Have a good day!	I guess I will make an explicit donation agreement for Save the children, maybe I'll donate 30.00 to help them out in the future.	Thanks, that is awesome
20180827-033057_106_live	I'm doing well, a little tired.	How are you?	Im a perfect world where I had all the resources and money I could stand, I would love to be a philanthropist.	I think childrens charities are a worthy cause.	But, I do not work and I seldom donate due to the needs of our family.	I do like Childrens healthcare of Atlanta as a charity.	What about you?	which charity are you passionate about?	Yes, I hear they feed starving children all over the world.	Really sad situation.	I couldn't imagine not being able to supply food for my kids.	Heart breaking.	I just read about a charity called The Project Linus, a group that supplies security blankets for terminally ill children.	All my kids love their security blankets.	Do you have any kids?	No i do not have any kids, but I have a soft heart for kids.	There is a good time and place for vaccines.	Save the Children do help with vaccines as well as food.	Crazy how 30.00 a month can change a child's future.	Another charity I read about is Reach Out and Read, they supply used books to doctors offices to help kids read by educating the nurses on talking to parents about the importance of reading.	I never heard of them before today, have you?	Internet research is a good way to learn about pretty much anything.	It's hard to come up with a bunch of conversation about charity.	It's easy to just live in your own world and not think about the horrible things in the world.	Charity is a good way to get a collective group of people to make a change in the world.	There are so many childrens charities like KABOOM, they build updated playgrounds for kids with disabilities.	Yea, I think thats most important.	There are so many so called charities that keep almost all of the donated funds and only a few pennies of each dollar actually go towards the need.	I read a blog about Sea World is a big donater to children's charities.	Make a Wish Foundation is a good one, have you heard of them?	Ive had a few of the charity HITs.	I like to learn about an array of different things.	I've actually been intrigued by alot of the things I've head on the HITs.	Save the children was one of the charities talked about on here.	I have a cousin who works with MercyShip.	They are an organization that sales to african countries and does hundreds of thousands of surgeries on children in need.	I'm grasping at straws now, 10 turns each is a monumental task just like fighting childhood cancer (not really) have you ever donated to charities for childhood cancer?

They are an organization that sales to african countries and does hundreds of thousands of surgeries on children in need.	I'm grasping at straws now, 10 turns each is a monumental task just like fighting childhood cancer (not really) have you ever donated to charities for childhood cancer?	Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities.	I cant even imagine what these poor families go through.	McDonalds does a charity that helps house families near hospitals so they can be together during a hospital stay.	Ronald McDonald House is the name I think.	It's been a pleasure chatting with you about children charities.	I think this is the last chat exchange.	Have a good day!	I guess I will make an explicit donation agreement for Save the children, maybe I'll donate 30.00 to help them out in the future.	Thanks, that is awesome

20180825-054948_621_live	Hello	Hi.	I really do not know much about children's charity, do you?	I think so.	Does it have commercials on tv?	Does this charity help children in the United States, or do they deal mostly with children in African nations?	I will copy and save the website address.	What do volunteers do for this charity?	I ask that because volunteering would be easier for me than sending money.	That is awesome that your friend does that!	I'm not a nurse though, and couldn't possibly travel to Africa or anywhere else.	No, I honestly don't have any money.	If I did have extra money, I would probably donate to St Jude's.	I have given a few extra cents sometimes at the checkout in grocery stores.	No, not really.	I can count on one hand the number of times I've had starbucks coffee.	Very rarely do I spend money on unnecessary things, money is that tight.	I do feel bad there are starving kids in this world, but until my situation changes, there is nothing I can do for them or anyone else.	I've done that before on other tasks.	Wouldn't it be easier for the research team to have their survey, and ask for donations at the end of the survey?	So if my reward amount on this hit is .30 cents, just give "Save the Children" this .30 cents, and we will call this task complete.	Thank you, you too.

No, I honestly don't have any money.	If I did have extra money, I would probably donate to St Jude's.	I have given a few extra cents sometimes at the checkout in grocery stores.	It sure is for me too.	No, not really.	I can count on one hand the number of times I've had starbucks coffee.	Very rarely do I spend money on unnecessary things, money is that tight.	I do feel bad there are starving kids in this world, but until my situation changes, there is nothing I can do for them or anyone else.	I've done that before on other tasks.	Wouldn't it be easier for the research team to have their survey, and ask for donations at the end of the survey?	So if my reward amount on this hit is .30 cents, just give "Save the Children" this .30 cents, and we will call this task complete.	Thank you, you too.

You have my attention, however this HIT is running Very long for 2 bucks already.	No, you may not draw that conclusion yet.	I still know nothing about the charity and I\'m already a half hour into a 2 dollar HIT.	I do not do this "only" for the money, but to try and help any way I can.	That\'s the only reason I\'m still here.	I have been doing some research while waiting for your responses.	I'll donate .50.	You are welcome.	It would be more, but not without more research.	This HIT is a rip off, taking far too much time.	I am an old retired guy with limited income.	My wife has health issues and is losing her insurance.	Pennies matter to me.	Thank you.	I just hope the donation does help and do wish it could be more.	Most welcome indeed and hope you have a great day.	Should this HIT not be ending, I think it has had more than 10 rounds?

20180827-050740_909_live	Hi!	Feeling great.	Just got back from the gym	I'm pretty poor.	If I have money I try to donate to charities that I like.	No.	I don't believe I have.	I would not be interested in a charity that only targets children.	I've lived for 76 years and have only experienced two reasonably good presidents.	The way things are going I don't expect to experience any thing close to that again.	My few cents would never go toward a children's charity.	If I have anything it will go to homeless shelters, food pantries and environmental causes.	That would be real low on my list of priorities.	People that demand perfect victims can donate to children's charities; I don't do that.	I prefer to prioritize charities where lots of people don't like the victims.	Most people (unlike me) seem to like children so those charities don't have any trouble.	That really wouldn't bother me at all.	I'm not donating to your children's charity.	How much are you donating?

If someone believes they can take advantage of your ignorance, a lot of times, they will.	It's a shame, but I want her to know her rights so that she is never taken advantage of by someone in a higher position of power.	Wherever and whoever that may be.	It makes me scared for her and my nephews as well.	I hope we can fix the bad in the world by the time they grow older.	have noticed so many kids that are kinder and more aware than when I was younger.

Especially for third world country that have limited resources	If we can donate alot to these organizations alot can be accomplished in the world.	definitely.	The more the merrier however anything as little as 10 cents can make a huge impact	If we can get a group of Investors this organization can reach a larger spectrum	Yeah that means they need to develop a good marketing strategy to attract more attention	Yea they should hire a specialist that can go into social media like Facebook, Instagram, and other sites to build a presence	Sure I like their mission and believe it can help a long way to help others	I would love to donate $.50 cents	Sounds good, thank you!

I do not have children of my own and am not able to have them.	I am contemplating adoption for the future.	Wow, that is a staggering amount.	I did not know that.	I am a big fan of organizations who take care of the needs of hurt children.	I have!	They seem to be doing a good job.	I am not surprised to hear that at all.	Children should not have to do through so much tragedy and devastation at such young ages. It is great that others are looking out for them.	I probably will do that.	If everyone did something, it helps the bigger overall picture and they are so worth it.	How noble of you!	I just know that if I were a child in need, I would be grateful for all the help I could get.	Wow, that is so good to hear.	I'm sure it is not easy for organizations to get charitable work done but I am grateful they try and that others get involved.	Kuddos to them!	The life of a child is always worth saving.	You have a good day as well.

20180808-011921_673_live	Hello how are you today?	Hi, I'm great, how are you?	Yes, I have.	I am not extremely familiar with them, but I have seen several ads for them.	Yes, I would be happy to donate to that charity.	Do you have an amount in mind?	I do, too.	I tend to find it easy to be sympathetic towards several different types of charities.	From what I have seen about Save the Children I've always been impressed with the work they do.	I agree.	I feel much better donating to places where I feel confident that the money  is going to where they say it will.	I think Save the Children is the biggest charity of it's kind.	I'm like you.	I always try to donate anonymously.	I don't feel the need to be recognized for any good I can do.	That's funny that you mention that.	I always wonder how many people donate any bonuses that are offered to them.	I always donate most if not all of any money I am offered.	I figure that I wasn't expecting it to begin with so better to do some good however much.	Yes, some of these Universities really impress me with how much they are willing to donate.	I know some of them get  really large amounts for studies and I appreciate when they use the money to do some good while gaining research.	Yes, and then most are willing to provide proof that they actually donated money, so that is good.	Thank you so much, same to you!

That sounds good, thank you for being charitable.	Yes, I feel like if anything could use more funding, it should be children who need extra assistance.	Hm, it depends on my schedule to be honest because I still have to pay rent and I don't have set hours but I'd be willing to give around $100 if I have solid hours every month.	You're welcome.	Do you know what these children are suffering from and what the money will be funding?	Wow, I can't even fathom feeling starved as a child or experiencing violence at a young age (outside of television/video games).	Thank you for linking the website, I will check it out right now.

20180904-012448_306_live	Hello, I would like to speak to you about Save The Children .	No, please tell me more.	Do they have a car?	How do they do that?	The exchange rate must be pretty good.	How do they ensure that the money is effective in feeding the children and not lining pockets?	How do they define "Program services", and do they have independent verification of those findings?	That really isn't an answer to the previous question, though	That is a solid informational link, including a full board of trustees to look into.

20180808-032545_201_live	HI GOOD MORNING	Good morning.	How are you today?	I don't usually donate to charities.	Is that something that you personally do?	I like the fact that it's an international organization.	What kinds of things do children's charities do?	I took a look at the website.	So it looks like the money goes toward health and education?	Things like that?	I'm still not sure.	I worry that my money won't actually go to the children, that it'll just be paying for someone's job at the charity.	Do you know how much of the donation goes to the children?	I heard that, with some organizations, only 10% of the money goes to the recipient!	That makes me feel much better.	Does your organization provide receipts, for tax purposes?	How does a person go about making a donation?	On the website?	What kind of payments do you take?	Do you take credit cards?	I think that you convinced me.	I'll definitely go and make a donation today.

Oh, thanks for the website, I am sure that it has a lot of information that I could use to learn more about it.	This sounds really good!

I am trying to understand how it is decided what child in need gets the help.	Okay I will be sure and research the organization to better understand.	Lets do $1.00 for now but I am glad you have made me aware of an organization that I can look into in order to help others.	No problem. I do understand how every little bit helps and how we do not have to give as much if we can get others involved and for a good cause.	Sounds great. Is there are reason that you have chosen to raise money for Save the Children?	I believe every child deserves the chance to have food in their bellies and an education to be able to help others when they get to adulthood.	This is so true.	The reason I ask is because I have cared for abused and neglected children and see the results and how it effects them for the rest of their lives.	I am very curious to how the decision is made and what type of medical care they plan to deliver.

I am aware of the violence in Syria but what has "Save the Children" done to aid in health, education and safety?	Before I can donate I will need to know how this organization has help.	How has "Save the Children" helped to aid in health, education and safety of the Syrian children?	Send over rights?	I do not understand.	I also agreed to donate but before that I need more information, why do you keep asking me to donate?	Because you keep asking the same question for someone that conversing about donating to a charity.	Exactly, in today\'s world one must be weary of scammers.	Those who are really trying to do "good" for others will be more than happy to show proof of where donations are going or at least letting one know how those donations will be put to use.	Telling me where it goes really does nothing for me.	Why the aggressive tone of me "donating or not"?

20180903-103835_253_live	Hello there, how are you?	Hi	I know that it is a charity.	I think I have seen some commercials for it in my lifetime.	No.	I figured they just tried to help children in under developed countries.	That's great that they help people in the U.S. as well!	I think it's important to help children from our country and also others.	That's wonderful!	Are you a top rated charity?	How much goes to administrative costs?	Wow!  That's really great!	I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.	I think this is a fair percentage to have.	I think that's great!	What country is in the most need right now?	That's sad that a country as powerful as the USA still has problems with children in need.	What is the money used for mostly?  Food?  Toys?  Clothes?	I think this is all very interesting stuff.	I've never had the chance to talk to a charity before.	That's terrible.	I hope this kind of environment changes for them.	Children deserve to be in a safe place and to feel secure.	I can imagine!	I hope lots of people donate to you.	I bet it's especially good around Christmas when people are in the spirit of giving.

How much goes to administrative costs?	Wow!  That's really great!	I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.	I think this is a fair percentage to have.	I think that's great!	What country is in the most need right now?	That's sad that a country as powerful as the USA still has problems with children in need.	What is the money used for mostly?  Food?  Toys?  Clothes?	I think this is all very interesting stuff.	I've never had the chance to talk to a charity before.	For example,Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.	That's terrible.	I hope this kind of environment changes for them.	Children deserve to be in a safe place and to feel secure.	I can imagine!	I hope lots of people donate to you.	I bet it's especially good around Christmas when people are in the spirit of giving.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.	That's terrible.	I hope this kind of environment changes for them.

20180826-194841_403_live	Hello!	Hey, I am fine!!	How are you	It sounds familiar.	I think I have heard of it.	Yeah, I just looked it up.	:)  I like that it's non-governmental.	I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past.	Like when I was in my twenties, but these days I have only made donations to animal rescue groups within the past two years.	It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.	How were these children killed or injured -- because I know that many people (children too) are slaughtered on the highway in horrific road accidents.	If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?	I watched a video on YouTube a couple of years ago.	It was Syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures.	It completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.	Their lives were in danger constantly from the threat of terrorism.	Me too.	I think about the little face I saw and since it was so long ago, I wonder if each and every one is okay -- still alive.	Absolutely.	I hope everyone does.	Whatever my task payment will be.	I have no money right now which is why I'm on Mturk tonight.	I live with my parents and I just bought a car last week which caused me an overdraft which I won't be caught up on until this coming Friday.	I'm very sorry I can't donate more tonight.	I would if I had at least $200 in my bank account.	I hope it wsn't a waste of your time.	You're welcome!	It was nice talking, thanks for all you do.	God bless you.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	Yeah, I just looked it up.	:)  I like that it's non-governmental.	I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past.	Like when I was in my twenties, but these days I have only made donations to animal rescue groups within the past two years.	It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.	How were these children killed or injured -- because I know that many people (children too) are slaughtered on the highway in horrific road accidents.	If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?	I watched a video on YouTube a couple of years ago.	It was Syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures.	It completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.	Their lives were in danger constantly from the threat of terrorism.	Me too.	I think about the little face I saw and since it was so long ago, I wonder if each and every one is okay -- still alive.	Absolutely.	I hope everyone does.	Whatever my task payment will be.	I have no money right now which is why I'm on Mturk tonight.

Yes, I do	There were periods in my childhood when money was very short and we had our telephone or power cut off, but I always had a safe place to live and food to eat.	What was life like for you growing up?	Did you have any worries about food, shelter, safety, etc.?	I don't have any experiences like that but I'm sure it must have been very difficult and scary to go through that as a child.	Did you ever use the services of any organizations for children to help you through the rough times?	No, I didn't either.	My family would just get through somehow.	I have made donations in the past, but our money is bit tight since I'm a stay-at-home mom right now.	If I make donations now, they are in-kind donations rather than monetary donations.	What organizations do you donate to?	I tend to make donations to a emergency children's shelter.	Yes, I have.	No, I didn't know that they are helping children near to us.	Do you mean in the USA?	I didn't realize that.	I've been following the news about family separations very closely.	I'm glad organizations like Save the Children are helping.	Sure, I will donate 50 cents to them.

I would gladly give my earnings to this charity.	Children hold the future of the world.	I know, it always amazes me how many children are suffering around the world.	It is so sad.	Though MTurk they should raise quite a bit.	Even though it is only .30 for this hit, with the number of people it adds up.

It is hard to watch and not reach out to help a child.	I do what I can in my own community and the town comes together this time of year to make sure each child has school supplies.

20180825-080802_964_live	Hi, good morning!	Hello!	No, I didn't see anything.	I'm a little familiar with the charity though.	That's good to know that almost 90 percent of all donations go directly to help children.	We know it's a problem not just in the United States.	I most likely will.	I would like to read some more information, probably on their website, then donate from there.	How do they help children in other parts of the world?	That would be alright.	Yes, I would like to donate at least one dollar to help Save the Children.	I've heard on the news that many children around the world are with their families trying to escape wars.	I'm sure Save the Children helps them?	Yes, I agree.	It's difficult to watch the horrible things these children are going through.	Our children and grandchildren are so blessed.	So, Save the Children has somehow eliminated a high overhead cost.	Good for them.	I wish other charities would follow, especially local ones.	Ok.	I'm ready to donate, tell me how!	No problem.	I'm always about children.	I agree, this is a good cause.	It was great chatting with you.	Have a great weekend!

We know it's a problem not just in the United States.	I most likely will.	I would like to read some more information, probably on their website, then donate from there.	How do they help children in other parts of the world?	That would be alright.	Yes, I would like to donate at least one dollar to help Save the Children.	I've heard on the news that many children around the world are with their families trying to escape wars.	I'm sure Save the Children helps them?	Yes, I agree.	It's difficult to watch the horrible things these children are going through.	Our children and grandchildren are so blessed.	I really wish more people could understand the importance of helping other, less fortunate then ourselves.	So, Save the Children has somehow eliminated a high overhead cost.	Good for them.	I wish other charities would follow, especially local ones.	Ok.	I'm ready to donate, tell me how!	No problem.	I'm always about children.	I agree, this is a good cause.	It was great chatting with you.	Have a great weekend!

20180827-004200_630_live	Hello	Hi.	Yes.	I would very much like to donate.	Well, I don't have much money right now.	All I can afford is $5.00.	That's so horrible.	I wish I could give more.	I sponsor a poor child in India every month for $40.	I wish I could help all the children in the world.	It is the least I can do for him.	Most people take for granted what they have in their lives, while there are so many thousands who do not even have the basic necessities.	Imagine not have clean water to drink.	I agree.	There is so much wasted in the world.	I know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water.	If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.	I sponsor through World Vision.	I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going.	You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.	And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.	It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.	Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually.	I also send him little care packages every so often.	At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc.	That will have such a big impact on their lives.	Well, I know I said $5, but I think I will make it $10.	You are so welcome.	Thank you.	It has been a pleasure talking with you!	Thank you again for donating $10 to Save the Children.	It was a pleasure talking to you as well!

20180827-004200_630_live	Hi.	Yes.	I would very much like to donate.	Well, I don't have much money right now.	All I can afford is $5.00.	That's so horrible.	I wish I could give more.	I sponsor a poor child in India every month for $40.	I wish I could help all the children in the world.	It is the least I can do for him.	Most people take for granted what they have in their lives, while there are so many thousands who do not even have the basic necessities.	Imagine not have clean water to drink.	I agree.	There is so much wasted in the world.	I know it is possible for everyone to have enough food and water.	If only the governments and politicians of the world would stop fighting and actually work toward that goal.	I sponsor through World Vision.	I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going.	You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community.	And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general.

20180904-024226_703_live	Hi, how are you today?	I am fine.	And you?	I have, actually.	I'm often skeptical of big charities like that.	They sometimes don't put the money that is donated into the right projects.	I have just done some quick research and am inclined to donate when I have the opportunity.	If a charity is doing good work to feed the hungry, I will give what I have to spare.	I don't really have anything to give right now, but I will donate at another time when I have steady income.	I suppose not.	I mean, a penny is nothing in the grand scheme of things.	If I have a chance to donate when I'm a bit more financially stable, I will donate more.	Right now, I think I can spare a penny. :)	Alright.	Will the penny be taken from my mturk account?	That would be the most convenient thing for me.	Well, thank you for wishing me well.	May your days be pleasant, as well.	Warm and rainy here.	Hurricane season is upon us, so I'm keeping a really close eye on that.

I appreciate you telling me about this organization and directing me to their website.	Yes it is.	I always wanted children of my own and could never conceive a child.	So I have much empathy for these children and their needs.	I will tell friends and family to visit the charities website also.	How many years has Save The Children been doing charity work?	That's good.	These days there are tons of people asking for donations for fake charities, it's sad.	I want to thank you again for bringing awareness to this important charity.	In America food is plentiful and we sometimes have to stop and reflect, that other countries aren't as fortunate as we are!

20180825-075627_48_live	Hello, hope your great today.	I'm doing well, thanks!	Likewise to you.	I have not heard of that charity.	How long has this charity been in existence?	How are they rated as a charity?	Do you have access to their overhead and admin costs breakdown vs. what they actually spend on programs?	Ah..	I see, you misspelled the charity at the beginning.	I was wondering why you were talking about "save the hold ten" vs. "save the children."

20180825-060251_387_live	Greetings!	Good morning!	Have you ever donated to a children's charity?	I have as well.	Children are the most vulnerable people in our society.	I haven't heard of this one?	How does it help children?	That's awful.	I live in the US and wish we were doing more as a country to help these kids.	But private donations certainly help.	I'll certainly review it.	Usually I donate more to charities in my community, but international donations are important too.	Have you donated to this organization?	I have a small budget but know any amount matters.	Like this task would donate the mTurk payment to the charity?	How does that work?	Like most people who do mTurk, I do really need the money to pay my bills.	This is an important cause though.	I'll agree to pay half.	Hang on though.	We haven't each done ten responses per the instructions.	So we should do that to make sure we and the charity get paid right?	Same here.	This will be ten for each of us.	Have a great day!

I'll certainly review it.	Usually I donate more to charities in my community, but international donations are important too.	Have you donated to this organization?	I have a small budget but know any amount matters.	Like this task would donate the mTurk payment to the charity?	How does that work?	Like most people who do mTurk, I do really need the money to pay my bills.	This is an important cause though.	I'll agree to pay half.	Hang on though.	We haven't each done ten responses per the instructions.	So we should do that to make sure we and the charity get paid right?	Same here.	This will be ten for each of us.	Have a great day!

20180826-055352_947_live	Hello!	Hello	Know I have not.	Please explain to me in detail	Okay.	What is the organization called?	O I have heard of Save the children.	I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity.	Currently I do not donate to charities.	I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget.	I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.	I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today.	I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.	Okay.	So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?	Okay that is nice and simple.	It has been great to electronically meet you too.	I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.	So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States.	To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children.	For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?	That is cool that you lived in three different states.	Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota.	There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,  New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.	I completely agree with you.	I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty.	Especially with children.	The issue with children poverty has to change.	I will take the option of donating into consideration.	You as well. Thank you for the chat :)

For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?	That is cool that you lived in three different states.	Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota.	There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,  New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.	I completely agree with you.

So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States.	To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children.	For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?	I agree.	That is cool that you lived in three different states.	Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota.	There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,  New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.	I completely agree with you.	I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty.	Especially with children.	The issue with children poverty has to change.	I will take the option of donating into consideration.	You as well. Thank you for the chat :)

20180719-211301_463_live	No, I have not.	Can you tell me about it?	Is it just in one country, or do they work around the world?	That's so sad.	I wish I could do something to help.	Yeah, a few local charities.	Like our animal shelter, a low income housing group, foster care organziations, etc	I'll definitely check them out.	Any organization that helps kids is one worth supporting, either with my own time or with money.	I can't afford a lot right now because I have other bills, but I could probably do $5 now with more next month.	That's great!	It feels like so little, but if a lot of people do just a little bit, it really adds up!	Yeah I agree.	If I donate, even a little, I want it to actually go towards what it should, not just lining the pockets of the CEO.	I think I would like to see my donation go towards medical care.

20180723-042342_809_live	Hello how do you feel about the Save the Children charity?	I think it's a scam	I don't believe it.	There is no way to prove where all those funds go.	Plus there are starving children right here in america	That is all your opinion.	You have no facts to back that up.	Like I said those are opinions.	There are no facts that prove that to be true.	There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either.	I have never meet anyone who has been aided by that organization.	Infomercials don't impress me.	Yes they do.	Have you ever heard of evangelism?	Again, you're only giving me an opinion.	I just can't see any good being done.	I would not be willing to donate, because I have never seen any impact made by their organization.	They also don't disclose their funds	No, I care about  kids in my community, who are in poverty.	I have never seen this organization help them.	I'd rather contribute my donation locally.	Rather than to a scam organization that only contributes in their infomercials.	How long are you going to take to respond?	You're making this take far too long!.	How does that equate to reporting financial information?	That's nothing more than whats said in their infomercials.	There are no laws preventing them from lying, but i guess perception is reality too you.	You're missing the entire point of what I said if you think downloading that report means something.	I will not donate, because i do not trust the charity, and my donations would be better used right here in my own community.	No, but I see the work being done everyday in my community..	Which is why i trust them.
20180723-042342_809_live	I think it's a scam	Oh no not at all they do tons of good  is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I don't believe it.	There is no way to prove where all those funds go.	Plus there are starving children right here in america	That is all your opinion.	You have no facts to back that up.
