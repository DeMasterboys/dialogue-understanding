20180826-023807_40_live	Did you Know that Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.	I think I've heard of them, but aren't they religiously affiliated?	I'm all for improving conditions for children in developing countries, but I don't really want money paying for evangelizing.	How transparent are they about uses of their funds?	Are they well rated by the watchdog groups that keep an eye on non-profits?	It's great to hear there are people out there doing such important work.	Have you ever donated to them?	Really?	I suppose even with the economy being as hard as it is, exchange rates are still good enough to make a real impact.	That's a good point, I think a lot of the times the little things we can do that have really positive impacts kind of get lost in the shuffle.	If I can ask a personal question, how did you make room in your finances to donate?	So how did you decide what was right for you?	I'm certainly willing to listen.	Tell me about Bruce.	That poor girl, being rejected by her own family like that.	I'm glad that Bruce was taken in, though.	How did the visit go?	That's awesome!	He even made it through college.	I can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.	If only all kids were so lucky.	But I guess it takes a lot of work to try to help the ones who need it most	I will.	Be the change you want to see in the world, right?	5 dollars buys a latte, and I think it should be easy for me to give up a coffee a month.	I bet they have ways to set up recurring donations pretty easily.

That's a good point, I think a lot of the times the little things we can do that have really positive impacts kind of get lost in the shuffle.	If I can ask a personal question, how did you make room in your finances to donate?	So how did you decide what was right for you?	I'm certainly willing to listen.	Tell me about Bruce.	That poor girl, being rejected by her own family like that.	I'm glad that Bruce was taken in, though.	How did the visit go?	That's awesome!	He even made it through college.	I can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.	Yes he is a force for good and was saved out of tragedy.	If only all kids were so lucky.	But I guess it takes a lot of work to try to help the ones who need it most	I will.	Be the change you want to see in the world, right?	5 dollars buys a latte, and I think it should be easy for me to give up a coffee a month.	I bet they have ways to set up recurring donations pretty easily.

20180825-070515_947_live	what you think about save the children donation ?	I think it is a genuine organization who uses it's fundraising donations in the right way.	No I think they use most of their donations to actually help children.	Do you believe they don't?	I think there are a lot of safeguards in organizations like this one that is set up to prevent such a thing.	Yes, for sure.	I think they are a trustworthy organization.	I am not aware of that.	In fact, I believe they were a top-rated children's charity the last couple years.	I am pretty sure they do.	Like me, I think people donate to more children's charities than anything else.	Well it takes personnel and resources to run any organization so I'm sure some of the money goes to that but I suspect more goes to the children.	True, especially if you take part in donating.	However, I usually just give where I feel I need to and if people use it the wrong way, I believe they will get what's coming to them.	Maybe it is a blind trust but there's really no way to know for sure if they use the money correctly unless you are the person handling the money.	Well I'm sure there is always more that can be done.	I just feel that if they help a few children get a better childhood then it is worth it.	Children are our future.

I would be interested in donating five cents.	I could definitely do that.	Sorry I can't donate more :(

20180825-070857_925_live	Hello.	Yes I do.	I find it very fulfilling to give back	It is very scary to think about.	Not only are they ravaged by the volcano, now a hurricane.	I am curious what we can do to help.	Do you know anything about how they are helping the children?	That's really awesome, are they more in need of supplies or monetary donations?	Do they have a donation tier level?	I want to help out as much as I can.	Really?	What forms of payments are accepted?/	That is nice.	But I would like to give more than a measly $2.	Is there another way to donate?/	I would like to keep the payment for this HIT.	This goes into a different fund.	But I would like to be able $150 to this charity.	I can donate the .30 base payment but I am still very curious on donating outside the HIT.

20180826-220528_999_live	How do you feel about childrens charities?	I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society.	We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening.	I do have a soft spot for children.	As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through.	I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need.	Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.	yes I have.	In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general.	Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.	One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition.	Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.	I believe it could be true.	However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.	One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy.	If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.	Personally, transparency is especially vital.	When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.	In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.	If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.	Honestly, it should be a choice.	I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.	However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.	I think so.	Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.	If they don't, it's completely understandable.	In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to.	However, every cent counts.	It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is.	It's all about giving.	Those are very good questions.	It depends on the way they see it.	Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.	Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.	Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child.	Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to.	I have seen a lot of people do the same.	I think some people will say "maybe next time" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so.	When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.	Yes I would.	I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.	I can do 0.30 cents at the moment.

We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening.	I do have a soft spot for children.	As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through.	I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need.	Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.	I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses.	yes I have.	In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general.	Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.	One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition.	Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.	I believe it could be true.	However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.	One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy.	If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.	Personally, transparency is especially vital.	When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.	In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.	If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.	Honestly, it should be a choice.	I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.	However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.	I think so.	Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.	If they don't, it's completely understandable.	In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to.	However, every cent counts.	It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is.	It's all about giving.	Those are very good questions.	It depends on the way they see it.	Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.	Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.	Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child.	Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to.	I have seen a lot of people do the same.	I think some people will say "maybe next time" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so.	When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.	Yes I would.

Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.	I believe it could be true.	However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.	One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy.	If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.	Personally, transparency is especially vital.	When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.	In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.	If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.	Honestly, it should be a choice.	I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.	However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.	I think so.	Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.	If they don't, it's completely understandable.	In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to.	However, every cent counts.	It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is.	It's all about giving.	Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help.	Those are very good questions.	It depends on the way they see it.	Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.	Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.	Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child.	Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to.	I have seen a lot of people do the same.	I think some people will say "maybe next time" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so.	When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.	Yes I would.	I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.	I can do 0.30 cents at the moment.

I think some people will say "maybe next time" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so.	When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy.	Do you think that you would elect to give some of your task payment?	Yes I would.	I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children.	I can do 0.30 cents at the moment.
20180826-220528_999_live	I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society.	We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening.	I do have a soft spot for children.	As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through.	I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need.	Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.	yes I have.	In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general.	Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children.	One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition.	Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.	I believe it could be true.	However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate.	One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy.	If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.	Personally, transparency is especially vital.	When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.	In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.	If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem.	Honestly, it should be a choice.	I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily.	However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.	I think so.	Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so.	If they don't, it's completely understandable.	In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to.	However, every cent counts.	It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is.	It's all about giving.	Those are very good questions.	It depends on the way they see it.	Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could.	Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything.

20180826-184037_209_live	Hello, how are you?	Fine, thank you.	How do you feel about donating to a children's charity?	But do you really trust the charities that you give to?	Do you know if they are actually using that money for the intended purpose?	I agree, the local charities are good.	I don't trust the bigger charities.	I think most of the money that is donated goes towards salaries, etc.	I think it is better to help children yourself.	That way, you know what the money is being used for.	Also, when you do it yourself, it is a lot more rewarding.	How much do you usually donate every year>	That is good.	Do you have any kids?	I do not have any children yet.	do you think that having kids had a big effect on whether on not you are willing to donate to a children's charity?	That is a great way to think about it.	I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well.	So I think that we should donate .10 each to the children.	What do you think?	It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference.	If half the people in the world just donated 10 cents to such charities, then we would raise a LOT of money.	It is not necessary to donate hundreds of dollars.	Agreed.	We spend so much money on other things, but the moment someone asks for a little charity, we make up many excuses.	We will donate .10 and hopefully that will make a difference.

Do you know if they are actually using that money for the intended purpose?	So I also donate to the hospital and childrens cancer network because the money goes directly to research cancers that effect children.	I agree, the local charities are good.	I don't trust the bigger charities.	I think most of the money that is donated goes towards salaries, etc.	I think it is better to help children yourself.	That way, you know what the money is being used for.	Also, when you do it yourself, it is a lot more rewarding.	How much do you usually donate every year>	That is good.	Do you have any kids?	I do not have any children yet.	do you think that having kids had a big effect on whether on not you are willing to donate to a children's charity?	That is a great way to think about it.	I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well.	So I think that we should donate .10 each to the children.	What do you think?	It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference.	If half the people in the world just donated 10 cents to such charities, then we would raise a LOT of money.	It is not necessary to donate hundreds of dollars.	Agreed.	We spend so much money on other things, but the moment someone asks for a little charity, we make up many excuses.	We will donate .10 and hopefully that will make a difference.

20180825-061105_792_live	Hello.	Hello!	I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.	I feel really torn about the crisis.	I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.	At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.	I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.	I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call "stupid".	I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.	Sorry Im getting off topic.	With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.	My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.	SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.	I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!	I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.	They are the weak ones in my eyes.	I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.	I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.	I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.	I would lock into half.	I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!	Thanks for talking me thru this today!	It is been enlightning!

I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.	At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.	I actually didn't think of it like that.	I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.	I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call "stupid".	I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.	Sorry Im getting off topic.	With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.	My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.

I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.	At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.	I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked.	I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call "stupid".	I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.	Sorry Im getting off topic.	With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.	My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.	SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.	I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!	I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.	They are the weak ones in my eyes.	I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.	I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.	If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.	I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.	I would lock into half.	I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!	Thanks for talking me thru this today!	It is been enlightning!

20180825-063009_943_live	Hi WOuld you like to donate your payment for this task to save the children?	No, to be honest I am doing this task to save up extra money for myself.	I appreciate your position, but what exactly is Save the Children and how do I know that money will truly be used to help kids?	It sounds like a good idea, but I often get peppered with requests to donate money to various charities -- when I donate I do it to causes that I know about.	If I donated to every cause I would be giving away a lot of money and I already lose 20% to taxes.	What exactly would that 30 cents be used for and how would it help?	What part of the world will it go to?	I have to respectfully question the necessity -- don't my taxes already go towards billions of dollars of foreign aid?	And why do so many of these countries continually need help?	I have seen some of the images and video of the civil war there.	True -- but how much money is currently being provided by US and NATO to help?	I have to question that they have provided only tents.	Many countries have absorbed many refugees and I am fairly certain that way more aid than tents has been provided.	It may -- but at this point I really still have no idea what Save the Children is and I would want to research it anyway before I would agree to give money to it.	Additionally, I am just very skeptical of any organization that asks for money.	I never know who is in charge, who is taking what, and where the money truly goes.
