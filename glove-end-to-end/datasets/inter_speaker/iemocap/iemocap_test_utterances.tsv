Ses05M_impro08	D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?	Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.	Yeah.  That my service just goes out.	yeah.	And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-	Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.	Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.	Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.	Hmm. Mmm.	yeah.	It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.	Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --	Uh huh.	All right.	Yeah, I see that.	Okay.	Okay.	Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.	Uh huh, Okay.	Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.	Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.	It's so frustrating.	Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.	Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.	No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.	Okay.  Thanks.

And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.	This happens every two weeks?	You've lost your connection.	okay.	Hmm.  Mmm.	Has somebody tried to pin your site?	Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?	Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?	Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --	Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.	Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.	Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?	Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run.	Okay.  We're gonna get your -- a little black box is going to come up.  Do you see that?	Okay Uh- You've got your C calling, go ahead and type in directory list.	And hit enter.	Okay?  Can you tell me what that says?	Okay Okay, And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.	Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?	It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.	Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --	Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.	I completely understand.	Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.	Absolutely.  It's a new service we are offering.	Uh huh Uh huh We want you to be happy.  You're our customer.  You're the most important thing. Okay?	Great.  Well, that makes me very happy.  That makes us all happy here at D.S.L. Extreme.  Is there anything else I can help you with?	All right.  You have a wonderful day.  Call us anytime.

I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.	This happens every two weeks?	Yeah.  That my service just goes out.	yeah.	And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-	Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.	Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.	Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.	Hmm. Mmm.	yeah.	It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.	Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --	Uh huh.	All right.	Yeah, I see that.	Okay.	Okay.	Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.	Uh huh, Okay.	Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.	Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.	It's so frustrating.	Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.	Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.	No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.	Okay.  Thanks.
Ses05M_impro08	D.S.L. Extreme, can I help you?	This happens every two weeks?	Yeah.  That my service just goes out.	You've lost your connection.	okay.	Hmm.  Mmm.	Has somebody tried to pin your site?

Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --	Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.	Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.	Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.

Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.	Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?	It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.	Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --	Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.	I completely understand.	Absolutely.

Ses05M_impro08	Hi, I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.	Yeah.  That my service just goes out.	yeah.	And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-	Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.	Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.	Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.	Hmm. Mmm.	yeah.	It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.	Well, I- I can check that.

Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.	It's so frustrating.	Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.	Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.

And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.	Yeah.  That my service just goes out.	yeah.	And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like, you know, direct connect the modem to my computer, and then reset everything, and then put the router back in. And-	Is not, It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.	Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.	Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.	Hmm. Mmm.	yeah.	It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.	Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --	Uh huh.	All right.	Yeah, I see that.	Okay.	Okay.	Uh, it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.	Uh huh, Okay.	Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.	Oh, my God.  I can't even tell you how much of a relief that is.  I literally call and talk to five different people.  Like last week it went off and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with different people.  And I've been doing that like every, every other week for months now.	It's so frustrating.	Yeah, accountability.  It's awesome.	Wow.  You know I was thinking about changing internet providers, but but that- that really is enough to change my mind.	No.  I'm just gonna go have a fantastic day now.	Okay.  Thanks.	All right.  Bye, bye.
Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.	Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?	I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.	I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.	Nothing's impossible.	You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and	I	No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.	and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.	Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	Have you?  There's got to be something else.	I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.	If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.	Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.	I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.	It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-	But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.	Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.	You can.	You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.	You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.	But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.	And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?	I mean are you going in for interviews?	Are you presenting-	putting your best foot forward? or you	Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.
Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	That's really hard to hear.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.	Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	I just-- I	Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.	I don't know.	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Thank you.	I will, I will.

I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	That's really hard to hear.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.	Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	I just-- I	Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.	I don't know.	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Thank you.	I will, I will.
Ses05F_impro04	Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.	Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?	I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.	I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.	Nothing's impossible.	It's not fair.	You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and	I	No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.	and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.	Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	Have you?  There's got to be something else.	I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.	If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.	Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.	I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.	It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-	But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.	Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.	You can.	You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.	You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.

I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.
Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.

There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	Have you?  There's got to be something else.	I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.	If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.	Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.	I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.	It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-	But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.	Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.	You can.	You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.	You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.	But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.	And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?	I mean are you going in for interviews?	Are you presenting-	putting your best foot forward? or you	Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.
Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	That's really hard to hear.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.	Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	I just-- I	Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.	I don't know.	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Thank you.	I will, I will.

Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.	Have you?  There's got to be something else.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	That's really hard to hear.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.	Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	I just-- I	Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.	I don't know.	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Thank you.	I will, I will.
Ses05F_impro04	Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.	Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?	I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.	I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.	Nothing's impossible.	You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and	I	No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.	and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.	Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	Have you?  There's got to be something else.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.	If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.	Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.

I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.

Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Thank you.	I will, I will.
Ses05F_impro04	Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.	Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?	I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.	I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.	Nothing's impossible.	You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and	I	No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.	and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.	Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	Have you?  There's got to be something else.	I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.	If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.	Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.	I'm just worried.	I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.	It's the way it seems to me.

I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.

Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.

I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	You can.	You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.	You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.	But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.	And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?	I mean are you going in for interviews?	Are you presenting-	putting your best foot forward? or you	Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.
Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	That's really hard to hear.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.	Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	You can.

Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Thank you.	I will, I will.

I just-- I	Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.	I don't know.	I mean are you going in for interviews?	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Thank you.	I will, I will.
Ses05F_impro04	Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.	Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?	I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.	I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.	Nothing's impossible.	You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and	I	No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.	and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.	Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	Have you?  There's got to be something else.	I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.	If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.	Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.	I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.	It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-	But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.	Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.	You can.	You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.	You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.	But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.	And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?	I mean are you going in for interviews?	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	Are you presenting-	putting your best foot forward? or you	Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.
Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	That's really hard to hear.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.

You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.	But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.

I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Yeah, I follow up.	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.
Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	That's really hard to hear.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.	Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	I just-- I	Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.	I don't know.	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Thank you.

You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-	But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.	Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.	You can.	You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.	You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.	But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.	And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?	I mean are you going in for interviews?	Are you presenting-	putting your best foot forward? or you	Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	But um--	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.
Ses05F_impro04	Brian, I need help.	I don't know.  I mean, what am I supposed to do? I've It's not for lack of effort.  I've been trying.	How did you get a job?  What am I - What am I supposed to do?	I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.	No, I don't I don't want to accept that.  I think that's bullshit.	I don't know.  I feel like I've tried everything.	Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	That's really hard to hear.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.	Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	I just-- I	Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.	I don't know.	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Thank you.	I will, I will.

And it would help you get somewhere else.	and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.	Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	Have you?  There's got to be something else.	I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.

Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.	I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.	Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	I'm just worried.	It's three years.	That's really hard to hear.	I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.	Brian, I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh, I can't go get my hair and my nails done today, I mean like I can't eat.	I just-- I	Yeah, I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.	I don't know.	Yeah, and I look nice and I'm you know--	charismatic.	yah, to-totally, and I'm not--	Yeah, I always think so, but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.	Yeah, I follow up.	It's just like- it's a matter of-	not tall enough, not pretty enough, not--you know how this place is.	I mean, anything.	Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	But um--	Yeah.	Bartending, catering.	Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	yeah.	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	Thank you.	I will, I will.
Ses05F_impro04	Babe, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't give up.	Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?	I wish I had some answers for you, babe.  I mean-I don't know what to tell you.	I went to school and I got my degree.  And I got a job.	Nothing's impossible.	You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and	I	No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.	and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.	Wait, You can move up.  There's management programs in McDonalds and things like that.	[GARBAGE] No, I wouldn't, but I--	Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	Have you?  There's got to be something else.	I don't know what to tell you, babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know, maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up, but I mean I don't want you to move away, but at the same time, I don't like seeing you like this.	If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.	Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	Well, you know I'm not going to let you starve.	I understand, but you know what, you've been negative for three years.	It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-	But it's true, babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.	Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.	You can.	You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.	You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.

I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Yeah, I understand. maybe What jobs are we talking about?	Like- What's your ideal job?  What do you want to do?	Of course.	Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	So what's the something else?	You can't get a catering gig?  Well, I can call some friends.  I- Well, I did call some friends before, but you went in once and then never went back.	If I- If you- Will you stick with it?	Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	Thank you.	But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	You know I'll always help you.

I mean, I just don't--I don't know.  If you don't have a lot of qualification, where do you - where do you find work?  It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody, you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.	It's not fair.	That's fine.  I'd be willing to start anywhere.  I can't get a job.	I mean, on six seven and five an hour does not - does not pay the bills I mean.	I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	I mean I can do the McDonald's thing for a while as humiliating as that is, but I mean then what?  I mean You can't exactly move up in that kind of industry.	Oh come on, that's not what I envisioned for myself. Honestly, would you settle for being a manager at McDonalds?	This is humiliating.

Ses05M_script01_1b	What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	He was out here when it broke.	About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.	I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.	I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?	For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!	All right.  All right, just listen.	You know it's not just my business.	So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?	Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.	She's not Larry's girl.	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	what to hell with that!	I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	So what, I'm not fast with women?	Because it is.	[garbage] I don't know.  It's just,	she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	All right then, mom.	I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.	But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.	I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.	I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.	Well, I am thinking like that.	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.

Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	Are you crazy?	Must you be inspired?	You don't want to think like that.	All right.

So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you--	What do you want me to do?  I mean, You're old enough to know your own mind.	I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	Have you asked Annie yet?	Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.	The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.	Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.	No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  If you marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.	Now, what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	Are you crazy?	Must you be inspired?	You don't want to think like that.	All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  All of this, all of it, it's all just for you.	Well, I am thinking like that.	I don't understand you, do I?
Ses05M_script01_1b	He was out here when it broke.	About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.	I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	Yes, yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing, mom, we made a terrible mistake with Dad.	I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?	For Gods sake, three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!	All right.  All right, just listen.	You know it's not just my business.	So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?	Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.	She's not Larry's girl.	I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want, I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else, my whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	what to hell with that!	I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	So what, I'm not fast with women?	Because it is.	[garbage] I don't know.  It's just,	she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	All right then, mom.	I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.	But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.	I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else, I- I'll live someplace else, maybe New York.	The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	Yeah, I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.	I know that, mom.  Just you help me stay here.	Well, I am thinking like that.	I don't understand you, do I?	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.

What do you want--	But, Kate...	[LAUGHTER]	Calm yourself.	Calm yourself!	All right, all right.  Calm yourself.	You've got to believe. You've got to--	What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!	What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?
Ses05F_script01_2	She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?	What's going on here, Joe?	She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.	She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.	Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.	Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.	I want you to pretend like he's coming back!	Because if he's not coming back, then I'll kill myself.	Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?	Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.	You've got to believe. You've got to--	What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!	I can't help it!
Ses05F_script01_2	Why does that bother you?	Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.	What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	How do you know he is even thinking about it?	Well, so what.	Now, listen, Kate, just-	How do you know why she's waited?	Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?	What do you want me to do?

What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?

Ses05M_script01_1	What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.	Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	We have to say it to him.	For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!	All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	It's not just my business.	So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?	Oh, so it isn't just my business?	You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.	Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	She is not Larry's girl!	I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.	To hell with that!	So what?  I'm not fast with women.	Because it is.	I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.	But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.	I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.	I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	Yes.  On this, I would.	Well, you help me stay here.	I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses05M_script01_1	When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.

No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	He cried hard?	What do you want to do, argue with him?	how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.	Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.	I'm just saying.	I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?	Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that	Have you asked Annie yet?	Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?	Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.	Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.	No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.	Are you crazy?	All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.	Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?	I don't understand you, do I?	Yeah, I can see that.

You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.	Are you crazy?	All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.	Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?	I don't understand you, do I?	Yeah, I can see that.
Ses05M_script01_1	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.	Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	We have to say it to him.	For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	It's not just my business.	So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?	Oh, so it isn't just my business?	You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.	Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	She is not Larry's girl!	I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.	To hell with that!	So what?  I'm not fast with women.	Because it is.	I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.	But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.	I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.	I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	Yes.  On this, I would.	Well, you help me stay here.	I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.

Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!	The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.	All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	It's not just my business.	So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?

Ses05M_script01_1	What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?	Did you talk to him?	He cried hard?	What do you want to do, argue with him?	how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.	All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?	Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.	I'm just saying.	I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?	Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that	Have you asked Annie yet?	Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?	Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.	Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.

I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	She is not Larry's girl!	From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?	Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that	Have you asked Annie yet?	Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?	Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.	Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.	No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.	Are you crazy?	All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.	Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?	I don't understand you, do I?	Yeah, I can see that.
Ses05M_script01_1	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.	Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	We have to say it to him.	For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!	All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	It's not just my business.	So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?	Oh, so it isn't just my business?	You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.	Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	She is not Larry's girl!	From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?	I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want, I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.	To hell with that!	So what?  I'm not fast with women.	Because it is.	I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.	But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.	I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.	I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	Yes.  On this, I would.	Well, you help me stay here.	I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses05M_script01_1	What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?	Did you talk to him?	He cried hard?	What do you want to do, argue with him?	how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	The trouble is the God damn newspapers.

To hell with that!	So what?  I'm not fast with women.	Because it is.	I know her best, all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.	I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.	But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.	I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know, maybe New York.	I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	Yes.  On this, I would.	Well, you help me stay here.	I know that, mom.  Just, you help me stay here.	No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
Ses05M_script01_1	What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?	Did you talk to him?	He cried hard?	What do you want to do, argue with him?	how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?	To you it is and to me, but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face, Chris, but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?	The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up, missing like longer than Larry.	Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.	I'm just saying.	I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean, the girl is Larry's girl.	From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?	Well, you're a considerate fella, there's nothing wrong in that	Have you asked Annie yet?	Well, what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?	Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.	Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Well, that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean, you haven't seen her in five years.	No.  I don't want a -- look, your father thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now, what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because, I don't.	I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.	Are you crazy?	All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for, Chris?  I mean, this whole thing, it's all for you.	Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?	I don't understand you, do I?	Yeah, I can see that.

Ses05M_script01_1	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.	Why should he dream about him, walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?	We have to say it to him.	For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!	All right.  All right, mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	It's not just my business.	So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?	Oh, so it isn't just my business?	You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.	Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	She is not Larry's girl!

Okay.	Okay, great, go ahead.	It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.	No, No, No, I am grateful.	Did they take-	Yes, yes, exactly.	Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?	Because I paid it on time.	Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.

Okay.	Okay, great, go ahead.	It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.	No, No, No, I am grateful.	Did they take-	Yes, yes, exactly.	Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?	Because I paid it on time.	Right.	Yeah, but if I call back, I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.	That would be wonderful, that would be great seriously.	thank you, what's the number?	three two three	six four nine four. That would be so great, thank you so much.	I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.	It was horrible, but you've made it much better, thank you very much. Absolutely	You too, thank you so much, have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro08	Hi, sir.  How can I help you?	Okay.	[LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.	I kwon, it is ridiculous	yeah, I understand.

Okay, so where?, okay, all right, so where did you uh- locate your your bill?	In the mail?

Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...	if I call it up on the screen.	So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?	Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-	Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-	Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.	You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account, correct?	Yeah so- That --that did go through.	Um- I can try to do that for you, certainly.	Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.	Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.	yeah.

Ses05F_impro06	A good friend of mine passed away the other day.	Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?	That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?	I am so sorry,  It's-	It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?	Absolutely, absolutely.	It's the think	There's no reason for it.	Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?	yeah.	Is he an actor too, or-?	Yes of course, of course.	Was he very close to his family?	yeah.	Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.	Is there a funeral planned? or-	Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.	No problem.	Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.	yeah.	Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.	That's the best way to put it.	Absolutely.	Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.
Ses05F_impro06	A good friend of mine passed away the other day.	Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?	Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,	metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-	Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.	[BREATHING]	Kind of.	It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.	I just, I don't know.	I know.	And he could of...  He was pretty awesome	Uh,  We grew up together.	Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.	I feel really bad for his family, you know.	It must be really, really hard to lose a child.	Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-	[BREATHING]	I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.	Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.	Thank you.	Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something.	Thanks.	It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...	something happens and they die and it's like-	really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.	[BREATHING]	yeah.	It's hard to say good-bye.	[BREATHING]	yeah yeah.
Ses05F_impro06	Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?	Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,	That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?	I am so sorry,  It's-	It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?	Absolutely, absolutely.	It's the think	There's no reason for it.	Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?	yeah.	Is he an actor too, or-?	Yes of course, of course.	Was he very close to his family?	yeah.	Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.	Is there a funeral planned? or-	Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.	No problem.	Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.	yeah.	Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.	That's the best way to put it.	Absolutely.	Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.
Ses05F_impro06	Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?	metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-	That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?

Ses05F_impro06	A good friend of mine passed away the other day.

Pretty close.	[BREATHING]	Kind of.	It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.	I just, I don't know.	I know.	And he could of...  He was pretty awesome	Uh,  We grew up together.	Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.	I feel really bad for his family, you know.	It must be really, really hard to lose a child.	Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-	[BREATHING]	I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.	Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.	Thank you.	Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something.	Thanks.	It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...	something happens and they die and it's like-	really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.

Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.	That's the best way to put it.	Absolutely.	Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.

It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...	something happens and they die and it's like-	really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.	[BREATHING]	yeah.	That's the best way to put it.	It's hard to say good-bye.	[BREATHING]	yeah yeah.
Ses05F_impro06	Oh no, I'm so sorry. What happened?	That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?	I am so sorry,  It's-	It's the worst when they go like that. [GARBAGE] Was he young?	Absolutely, absolutely.	It's the think	There's no reason for it.	Yeah?  What'd he do?  What did they do?  How'd you know him?	yeah.	Is he an actor too, or-?	Yes of course, of course.	Was he very close to his family?	yeah.	Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.	Is there a funeral planned? or-	Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.	No problem.	Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.	yeah.	Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.	That's the best way to put it.	It's hard to say good-bye.	Absolutely.	Do you know what, if it was me that died, I'd really want you to be crying and being really upset too any way. So, I think you should definitely do this, because it's trying what it's supposed to be.
Ses05F_impro06	A good friend of mine passed away the other day.	Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,	metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-	Yeah.  We were.  Pretty close.	[BREATHING]	Kind of.	It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.	I just, I don't know.	I know.	And he could of...  He was pretty awesome	Uh,  We grew up together.	Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.	I feel really bad for his family, you know.	It must be really, really hard to lose a child.	Yeah.  And they were really supportive, like through the whole process, but-	[BREATHING]	I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.	Yeah, I'm just going to miss him.	Thank you.

Ses05M_script02_2	Well, so, what do you think?	About what?	It's ridiculous.	I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.	I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.	We We don't ever.  Have we ever?	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever	No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.	You don't understand anything I am saying.	I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.	No.	No.	No.	No.	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.	No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	Well, so, what do you think?	About what?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	What's bugging you then?	It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.	We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.	Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.	No, of course not.	I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --	you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?	A vacation?	A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?	Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Right.	Now, I know.  Me either	I'm trying the best I can.	Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	Oh, well look what we've got here.	Well, it isn't champagne.	Or not.

For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.	No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	Well, so, what do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.	What's bugging you then?	It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.	We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.	Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.	No, of course not.	I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --	you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?	A vacation?	A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?	Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Right.	Now, I know.  Me either	I'm trying the best I can.	Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	Oh, well look what we've got here.	Well, it isn't champagne.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	About what?	It's ridiculous.	I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.	What's bugging you then?	I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.	We We don't ever.  Have we ever?	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever	No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.	You don't understand anything I am saying.	I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.	No.	No.	No.	No.	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	I didn't say that.

And the fish will not show up.	You don't understand anything I am saying.	No, of course not.	I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.	No.	No.	No.	No.	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.	No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	Well, so, what do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	What's bugging you then?	It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.	We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.	Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.	No, of course not.	I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --	you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?	A vacation?	A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?	Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Right.	Now, I know.  Me either	I'm trying the best I can.	Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	Oh, well look what we've got here.	Well, it isn't champagne.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	About what?	It's ridiculous.	I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.	I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.	We We don't ever.  Have we ever?	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever	No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.

A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?	Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Right.	Now, I know.  Me either	I'm trying the best I can.	Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	Oh, well look what we've got here.	Well, it isn't champagne.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	Well, so, what do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	What's bugging you then?	It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.	We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.	Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.	No, of course not.	I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --	you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	No.	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?	A vacation?

No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Right.	Now, I know.  Me either	I'm trying the best I can.	Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	Oh, well look what we've got here.	Well, it isn't champagne.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	About what?	It's ridiculous.	I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.	I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.	We We don't ever.  Have we ever?	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever	No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.	You don't understand anything I am saying.	I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.	No.	No.	No.	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	No.	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.	No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.	Or not.

Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.	No.	No.	No.	No.	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	Right.	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.	No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	Well, so, what do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	What's bugging you then?	It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.	We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.	Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.	No, of course not.	I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --	you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?	A vacation?	A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?	Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Right.	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	Now, I know.  Me either	I'm trying the best I can.	Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	Oh, well look what we've got here.	Well, it isn't champagne.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	About what?	It's ridiculous.	I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.	I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.	We We don't ever.  Have we ever?	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever	No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.

I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	Oh, well look what we've got here.	Well, it isn't champagne.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	Well, so, what do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	What's bugging you then?	It's not that complicated.  We come down here, the grunions arrive, they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh, awe, look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.	We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.	Okey, They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.	No, of course not.	I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay, so --	you were fine on the phone call with Marge, eating dinner was fine,talking- uh washing the dishes, no problem.  All right.  So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so, all right, and I'm putting on my coat, I'm putting out the animals, I'm pulling the car out of the garage.	It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	What, you want me to blow in your ear?	Do you want to get married again?- What?  What, do you want a divorce?	A vacation?	A poodle, a backrub, a spa, a suicide pack?  What, Carla, what the hell do you want?	Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?	Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Right.	Now, I know.  Me either	I'm trying the best I can.	Maybe if you're with somebody else, too?	No, I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean, look at the view of the moon from here.	Oh, well look what we've got here.	Well, it isn't champagne.	Or not.
Ses05M_script02_2	About what?	It's ridiculous.	I'm sorry.  It's just, it's it's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Seriously, you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.	I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.	We We don't ever.  Have we ever?	Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever	No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.	You don't understand anything I am saying.	I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.	No.	No.	No.	No.	I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.	But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heavens sake, Augie, whatever I am doing, I'd rather it be with you.	Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.	No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie, I'm sorry.	Or not.

Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?

I rather not hope for some things.	No.	No.	No.	No no.	I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	Good.

So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.	No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses05F_script02_2	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.	I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.	For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.	We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.	Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.	No.	No.	No.	No no.	I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.

Ses05F_script02_2	Well, so?  What do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	I am not the only one, look at all these people.	I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.	Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	What's bugging you?	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.	Why not?	We miss them twice, it's not ever.	Well We will see them this year.	I thought you wanted to see it.	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.	Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.	Wait a minute, I got it.	Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	You want me to go get some champagne?	Take off our shoes?	You want to get married again?	What? What You want a divorce?	A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?	What.  Welcome to the human race.	No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.	No, I know me either.	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.	I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.	Well, look what we have got here.	Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	Or not.

Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.	Well We will see them this year.	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.	No.	No.	No.	No no.	I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.	No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses05F_script02_2	Well, so?  What do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	I am not the only one, look at all these people.	Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	What's bugging you?	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.	Why not?	We miss them twice, it's not ever.	Well We will see them this year.	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	I thought you wanted to see it.	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.	Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.	Wait a minute, I got it.	Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	You want me to go get some champagne?	Take off our shoes?	You want to get married again?	What? What You want a divorce?	A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?	What.  Welcome to the human race.	No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.	No, I know me either.	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.	I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.	Well, look what we have got here.	Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	Or not.

I rather not hope for some things.	Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	No.	No.	No.	No no.	I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.	No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses05F_script02_2	Well, so?  What do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	I am not the only one, look at all these people.	Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	What's bugging you?	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.	Why not?	We miss them twice, it's not ever.	Well We will see them this year.	I thought you wanted to see it.	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.	Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.	Wait a minute, I got it.	Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	No.	You want me to go get some champagne?	Take off our shoes?	You want to get married again?	What? What You want a divorce?	A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?	What.  Welcome to the human race.	No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.	No, I know me either.	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.	I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.	Well, look what we have got here.	Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	Or not.
Ses05F_script02_2	I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.	I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.	For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.	We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.	Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.

No, I know me either.	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.	I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.	Well, look what we have got here.	Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	Or not.
Ses05F_script02_2	Well, so?  What do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	I am not the only one, look at all these people.	Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	What's bugging you?	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.	Why not?	We miss them twice, it's not ever.	Well We will see them this year.	I thought you wanted to see it.	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.	Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.	Wait a minute, I got it.	Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	You want me to go get some champagne?	Take off our shoes?	You want to get married again?	What? What You want a divorce?	A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?	What.  Welcome to the human race.	No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.	Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	No, I know me either.	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.	I don't know.

Ses05F_script02_2	I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.	I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.	For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.	We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.	Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I feel like I am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up.	I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.	No.	No.	No.	No no.	I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	No, I know me either.	I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.	No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.

I did, I do want to see it.  I always want to see it, Augie.	For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	And I remember thinking, Finally, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.	No.	No.	No.	No no.	I want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out.	This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	I didn't say that.	For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	Good.  So maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person.	Yes, I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful on the water.  The gold white moon.	Well, look what we have got here.	No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.
Ses05F_script02_2	Well, so?  What do you think?	What I was just saying.	It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	I am not the only one, look at all these people.	Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	What's bugging you?	There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing.  And we say, Oh, wow.  Look at the little fish.  They go home, we go home.	Why not?	We miss them twice, it's not ever.	Well We will see them this year.	I thought you wanted to see it.	It's just fish, it's nothing to get traumatize over.	Okay, I been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here.	Wait a minute, I got it.	Okay, all right I got it.  You wanted it to be like the other time, okay no problem. Listen, You want to dance?	You want me to go get some champagne?	Take off our shoes?	You want to get married again?	What? What You want a divorce?	A vacation? A new carpet, a poodle?  A bag of ice cream, a suicide pack, what what Carla?  What the hell do you want?	What.  Welcome to the human race.	No, no I was just like you, I thought it will be all peaches and roses and- and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come. And the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be, HAHA baby the joke is on us.	No, I know me either.	Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	No, I know, but.  I know I don't make you happy.	Actually, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.	I don't know.  Seems like a pretty good spot to me I mean look at the view of the moon you got from here.	Well, look what we have got here.	No, I am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all.	Shh, If we're very quiet, the fish might come.	Or not.
Ses05F_script02_2	I am sorry.  It's just fish to me.	God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.	I just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like.	For heaven's sake Augie, grow up we are not going to see the grunions.	We never do.  Have we ever?  We never have.	Twice is every time we tried, that's ever.	No, we won't.  Augie it's like waiting for Santa Claus to come.

Ses05M_script01_3	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	So, you're not sorry I came?	Well-	You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.	You felt something that far back?	oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?	Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.	No, nothing like that.	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.	I don't I don't know where to start.	It's so mixed up with so many other things.	I lost them.	Just about all.	It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.	I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.	I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.	It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.	I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.	It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,	you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.	And I guess that included you.	I want you now, Annie.	Oh, Annie,	Annie I am going to make you a fortune.
Ses05M_script01_3	It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.	So, you're not sorry I came?	Well-	You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.	You felt something that far back?	oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.

Ses05M_script01_3	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.	So, you're not sorry I came?	Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.	I figured they would, your mother at least.	Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?	Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.	I almost got married two years ago.	Everyday since.	Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.	Not like that you're not.	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?	Even in your letters there was something ashamed.	You have to tell me.	It wouldn't work like this.	Yeah, sure.	How many?	Do you still feel like that?	Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.	[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?
Ses05M_script01_3	So, you're not sorry I came?	Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.	Well-	You feel it's wrong here, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me, Annie. I- I don't want to win you away from anything.	You felt something that far back?	oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?	Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.	No, nothing like that.	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.	I don't I don't know where to start.	It's so mixed up with so many other things.	I lost them.	Just about all.	It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.	I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.	I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.	It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.	I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.	It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,	you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.	And I guess that included you.	I want you now, Annie.	Oh, Annie,	Annie I am going to make you a fortune.
Ses05M_script01_3	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.

You felt something that far back?	oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?	Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	Lets go for a ride.  I I- I want to be alone with you.	No, nothing like that.	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.	You have to tell me.	I don't I don't know where to start.	It's so mixed up with so many other things.	I lost them.	Just about all.	It- It takes time to toss something like that off,I mean, because they weren't just men.	I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.	I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.	It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.	I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.	It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book, to to drive that car, the new car, and look at that new refrigerator. I mean,	you can take those things out of the war, but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not, then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.	And I guess that included you.	I want you now, Annie.	Oh, Annie,	Annie I am going to make you a fortune.
Ses05M_script01_3	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	It's all right.  It's a good thing.  It's lovely here.  The air is sweet.	Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.	I figured they would, your mother at least.	Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?	Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.	I almost got married two years ago.	Everyday since.	Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.	Not like that you're not.	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?	Even in your letters there was something ashamed.	You have to tell me.	I don't I don't know where to start.	It wouldn't work like this.	Yeah, sure.	How many?	Do you still feel like that?	Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.	[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?

Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.	I figured they would, your mother at least.	Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?	Oh, Chris I've been ready for a long time.	I almost got married two years ago.	Everyday since.	Well, I mean, until then you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  I mean, you sure can be ambiguous.	Not like that you're not.	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?	Even in your letters there was something ashamed.	You have to tell me.	It wouldn't work like this.	Yeah, sure.	How many?	Do you still feel like that?	Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.	[LAUGHTER] What will I do with a fortune?	Annie I am going to make you a fortune.

There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry.	There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am.	But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.	I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A.	Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.	what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here.	what The lady, what? the janitor?	I'm not saying that you're stupid, ma'am.

Please, have some compassion.  Is there something you can do?	Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.	No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.	No.	No, I'm not, I'm sorry.I'm not stupid.	Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.	Why not?	Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?	Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true.	Do you have a manager I could speak with?	Are you being straight with me?	Fine.

I don't-	I don't have time for this today, and-	Is there anything you can do?  Please, have some compassion.  Is there something you can do?	Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.	No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.	No.	No, I'm not, I'm sorry.I'm not stupid.	Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.	Why not?	Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?	Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true.	Do you have a manager I could speak with?	Are you being straight with me?	Fine.
Ses05F_impro01	ahh Yeah, this is the wrong line.  I'm sorry.  You need to go back over to line two B.  That's where you should have started from.	Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place.	Simply step to line two A, ma'am, I'm sorry.	There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--	I don't want to be rude here, ma'am, but line two B is where you need to be.  This is the line for registration.	I don't have those-	So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-	I don't have those forms, ma'am.  I can't help you.  That's why you need to go to line two A.	Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry.	There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am.	But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.	I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A.	Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.	what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here.	what The lady, what? the janitor?	I'm not saying that you're stupid, ma'am.  I think you just said that you were stupid.	It doesn't work that way here, ma'am.	There is a strict system here.  You need to wait in the right line for the right thing.  This is the line for registration.	I told you it was line two A.	I don't know who told you that but they were wrong.  I'm sorry.	I'm being very straight with you, ma'am.

I think you just said that you were stupid.	It doesn't work that way here, ma'am.	There is a strict system here.  You need to wait in the right line for the right thing.  This is the line for registration.	I told you it was line two A.	I don't know who told you that but they were wrong.  I'm sorry.	Are you being straight with me?	I'm being very straight with you, ma'am.  There is nothing I can do for you.  You need to stand in line two A.
Ses05F_impro01	Hi, I need an ID.	Okay, I'm sorry, but I just stood in this line for an hour.  can I Is there any way I can-	No, they told me-I'm sorry, but they told me to be in this line.	What, I mean what... what's the difference?  What do I need to do there that I can't do here?	Can you just-can I just get the right-	Would you be able to put me at the front of that line?	I know.  I've been in line with these people.  I understand.  I understand what it's like.  Could you please like call over and-	I hear that.  I hear that.  Thank you, but I've waited in line for so long, and I don't want to have to be here all day.	So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-	And how long is that going to take?	I don't-	I don't have time for this today, and-	Is there anything you can do?  Please, have some compassion.  Is there something you can do?	Please, I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking, maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand, and they told me here.	No, they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.	No.	No, I'm not, I'm sorry.I'm not stupid.	Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.	Why not?	Except they're going tell, are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?	Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true.	Do you have a manager I could speak with?	Are you being straight with me?	I'm being very straight with you, ma'am.  There is nothing I can do for you.  You need to stand in line two A.	Fine.
Ses05F_impro01	ahh Yeah, this is the wrong line.  I'm sorry.  You need to go back over to line two B.  That's where you should have started from.	Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place.	Simply step to line two A, ma'am, I'm sorry.	There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--	I don't want to be rude here, ma'am, but line two B is where you need to be.  This is the line for registration.	I don't have those-	I don't have those forms, ma'am.  I can't help you.  That's why you need to go to line two A.	Ma'am, obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry.	There's nothing I can do for you, ma'am.	But, obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.	I am a very compassionate person, and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course, I'm compassionate.  Look, I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A.	Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.	what, no, I'm sure they did not tell you here.	what The lady, what? the janitor?	I'm not saying that you're stupid, ma'am.

Ses05M_script03_1	I wonder.	what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	What do we do?	Now and always, my sweet.	It was bound to happen sooner or later.	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.	Who's they?	If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	Well, will we always bicker and fight?	What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?	Elliott, worms don't pop.	I know you did.  You threw it out the window into the Canal below.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.	You knew there was nothing in that.

Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.	uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.	Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.	No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	Yes, yes, with all his might.	No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.	[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.	I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.	Horrible thing.  I hated it.	How long did that roue last?	Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?	[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?	Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.	I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]	We were very much younger then.

Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--	things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.	Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.	Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.	All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.	uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.	If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.	No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	Yes, yes, with all his might.	No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.	[garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.	I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.	Horrible thing.  I hated it.	How long did that roue last?	Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?	[LAUGHTER] That was quit a rouser, wasn't it?	Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.	I should never forget his face. [LAUGHTER]	We were very much younger then.

Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?	Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?	Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?	Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.	Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?	Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?	Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.	Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.	That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.	I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.	Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.	That's just dumb.	I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!	This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.

Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.	Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?	Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?	Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.	Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.	That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.	I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.	Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.	That's just dumb.	I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!	This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.
Ses05M_impro01	Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.	What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?

Ses05M_impro01	No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --	What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?	I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.	Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?	Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.

Ses05M_impro01	Can I help you?	Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..	Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.	Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-	No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --	What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?	Sir, don't get an attitude with me.	No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.	I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.	You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.	I know.	Sir, you- I mean	You can waist as much as you want	Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.	I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.	Sir, please don't waste my time.	There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.	They're different forms, we process them all different-	I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.	Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.	They're processed differently.	Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.	I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.	But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.	Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.

You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?	Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.	Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.	That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.	I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.	Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.	That's just dumb.	I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!	This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.
Ses05M_impro01	What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?	I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.	Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?	Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?	Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?	Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.	Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.	Why can't we just -- you know what?

Ses05M_impro01	Can I help you?	Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..	Right, but this is the wrong form.

No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.

I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.	Sir, please don't waste my time.	There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.	They're different forms, we process them all different-	I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.	Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.	They're processed differently.	Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.	I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.

I see -- you know, if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me, or something like that, you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?	Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.	Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.	That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.	Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.	I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.	Well, then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.	That's just dumb.	I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!	This is crap.  You know, I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.
Ses05M_impro01	Can I help you?	Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..	Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.	Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-	No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --	Sir, don't get an attitude with me.	No, I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.	I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.	You- You can ask her if you want, but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.	I know.	Sir, you- I mean	You can waist as much as you want	Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.	I can't take this one, sir. this is the wrong form.	Sir, please don't waste my time.	There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.	They're different forms, we process them all different-	I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.	Sir, don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.	They're processed differently.	Sir, you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.	I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.	I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.	But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.	Well, that's unfortunate, sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.
Ses05M_impro01	What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?	I'm not getting a -- well, you wait in this line and not get an attitude.	Well then, when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D, why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?	Well, it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?	Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?	Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.	Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?	Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.

Ses05M_script02_1	What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?	Fine.	What flashlight?	Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.	Augie.	I'm just not.	Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.	We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses05M_script02_1	What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?	Fine.	What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.	The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.	Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.	How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?	Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.	I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]	Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something	Do you want my jacket?	Oh	Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.	Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,	and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.	I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.	Yeah, they do.	All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.	For real?	I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.	Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.	Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;	somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-	And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,	they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.	Well, so what do you think?
Ses05M_script02_1	Fine.	What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?

Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.	Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.	Augie.	I'm just not.	Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.	We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses05M_script02_1	Fine.	What flashlight?	I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]	Pass what up?

Ses05M_script02_1	What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?	What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.	The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.	Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.	How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?	Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.

It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.	Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,	and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.	I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.	Yeah, they do.	All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.	For real?	I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.	Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.	Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;	somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-	And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,	they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.	Well, so what do you think?

God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.	Well, so what do you think?
Ses05M_script02_1	What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh, this is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though, so how are you doing?	What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.	The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?  Stupid.	Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.	How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?	Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.  Oh, this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh, a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.	I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh, [LAUGHTER]	Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something	Do you want my jacket?	Oh	Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	I mean, Think about people in Kansas, they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.	Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,	and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.	I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.	Yeah, they do.	All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.	For real?	I don't get it.  I mean, the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.	We didn't see them the first time either.	Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.	Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;	somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-	And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,	they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.	Well, so what do you think?
Ses05M_script02_1	Fine.	What flashlight?	Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science, this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.	Augie.	I'm just not.	Well, if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, we had a big argument, you had a sore throat, and we didn't see the grunion.	We didn't see them the first time either.	Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.

Ses05F_script03_2	You knew there was nothing in that.	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	You let him kiss you.  You said you did.	What of it?	Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?	I'll have a little I think.	You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	Really, Amanda.	Oh, that reply has broken my heart.	Oh, yes it is.	It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	They snap.	[BREATHING]	Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.	You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.	Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.	You better turn that off I think.	Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.	Turn it off.	Turn it off.	Amanda-- Listen- Listen-	Very music- amusing indeed.	You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.	Shut up, shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.
Ses05F_script03_2	Only a trivial little broach.	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	You let him kiss you.  You said you did.	What of it?

I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.	I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.	Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.	It's becoming a habit with you.	Just making myself fascinating for you.	Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	adder don't snap, they sting.	They sting.	I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.	Yes, I did quite a bit.	Mind your own business.	Oh dear, you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.	Oh, You are so insufferable.  Do you stop.	Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.	Ugh.	Why?	There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.	They're away in Tunis.	Turn it on again.	Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.	Well, do try to control yourself darling.	You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.	I- I hate you.	I hate you.	No, no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.	Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.	Oh, marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean, you're completely outrageous.

Ses05F_script03_2	You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	You let him kiss you.  You said you did.	What of it?	Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	So am I, bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?	I'll have a little I think.	You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	Really, Amanda.	Oh, that reply has broken my heart.	Oh, yes it is.	It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	They snap.	[BREATHING]	Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.	You must have a riotous time, no restraint at all, very enjoyable.  I mean, you never had much anyway.	Oh, This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.	You better turn that off I think.	Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.	Turn it off.	Turn it off.	Amanda-- Listen- Listen-	No, no.

Ses05F_script01_1	What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	He saw it.	He was out here when it broke.	Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.	I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	I guess, he is.	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.	Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?	We have to say it to him!	For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.	All right, All right mom.  Listen!	You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	You know that's not just my business.	So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?	I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	To hell with that!	So what, I'm not fast with women.	Because it is.	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?	All right, then, Mom.	I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?	The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?
Ses05F_script01_1	What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	He saw it.	Did you talk to him?	He cried hard.	He is thinking about him again.	It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.	What's the meaning of that?	To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?	Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?	I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.	Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.	Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.	Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?	Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.	You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	What the hell is this?	Are you crazy?	Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?	Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!	All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!	I don't understand you, do I?

I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	He is thinking about him again.	I guess, he is.	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.	Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?	We have to say it to him!	For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.	All right, All right mom.  Listen!	You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	You know that's not just my business.	So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?	I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	To hell with that!	So what, I'm not fast with women.	Because it is.	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?	All right, then, Mom.	I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?	The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?

The girl is Larry's girl.	Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.	Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.	Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?	Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.	You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	What the hell is this?	Are you crazy?	Wait a minute.  Tell me this.

But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!	I don't understand you, do I?
Ses05F_script01_1	What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	Did you talk to him?	He cried hard.	He is thinking about him again.	It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.	What's the meaning of that?	To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?	You know.	Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?	I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.	Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.	Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.	Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?	Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.	You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	What the hell is this?	Are you crazy?	Wait a minute.  Tell me this.

I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	I guess, he is.	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.	Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?	We have to say it to him!	For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.	All right, All right mom.  Listen!	You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?	You know.	Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	You know that's not just my business.	So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?	I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	To hell with that!	So what, I'm not fast with women.	Because it is.	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?	All right, then, Mom.	I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?	The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?

Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!	All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!	I don't understand you, do I?
Ses05F_script01_1	He saw it.	He was out here when it broke.	Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.	I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	I guess, he is.	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.	Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?	We have to say it to him!	For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.	All right, All right mom.  Listen!	You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	You know that's not just my business.	So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?	I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	To hell with that!	So what, I'm not fast with women.	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?	All right, then, Mom.	I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?	The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?
Ses05F_script01_1	What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	Did you talk to him?	He cried hard.	He is thinking about him again.	It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.	What's the meaning of that?	To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?	Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?	I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.	Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.	Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.	Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?	Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?	The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have	Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.	Because it is.	No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.	You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	What the hell is this?	Are you crazy?	Wait a minute.  Tell me this.

Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!	Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.	All right, All right mom.  Listen!	You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?	You know.	I'm going to ask her to marry me.	You know that's not just my business.	So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?	I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.	To hell with that!	So what, I'm not fast with women.	Because it is.	I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?	All right, then, Mom.	I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.	I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?	The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?	All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!
Ses05F_script01_1	He saw it.	He was out here when it broke.	Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.	I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.	No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	I guess, he is.	I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.	Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.	Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?	We have to say it to him!	For God's sake, mom, three years.

Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Okay, what flight were you on?	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.

And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Right.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.

Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you.

You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	Are you sure?	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.

Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?

Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.

That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.

Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.

Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.

It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.

I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.

Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.

Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	And you have no guarantee.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.

You know, Like if you--	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	Uh, so it was really heavy.	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.	Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	makes up?	The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	Right.	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	Right.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.
Ses05F_impro05	Okay, what flight were you on?	On what airline?	From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Okay.  Well, let me see here. I-	It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	And you couldn't find it?	Are you sure?	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	Sentimental value.	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Well,	Obviously ma'am.	I am sorry, ma'am.	Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Obviously, we're not trying to lose your luggage.  Do you really believe that we're trying to lose your luggage ma'am?	Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	Right. Yes, ma'am.	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	Well, my hands are really tied then.	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more.

Okay, just fill out these three forms, and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and, of course, we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.	Thanks.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05F_impro05	Hi,um- I think my baggage was lost, and I need to I guess file a claim or I don't know what.	Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Yeah, I don't know where it was lost.  I was coming from Africa, so.	Right.	Yeah.	That's good.	Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Right, well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when it's going to get here?	Yes, sir, I know what my bag looks like.	Um- It's a travel backpack.  It's green and gray.  It's got my name on it and my information.	No, it didn't turn up at the baggage claim.	I mean we've gone through all of this.  I've been to five people already who--	Okay.	Yes, lots of really like -- sentimental value only, but--	Does this happen often?  Do they--you just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it?	Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.	Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.	That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?	Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.	Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.	There's nothing else you can do?	I don't believe that for a second.	What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?	You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-	So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?	And you have no guarantee.	This is ridiculous.	Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.	Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.	No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.	It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.	Yeah, I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.	Thanks.	You have a wonderful day.
Ses05M_script03_2	Only a trivial little broach.	You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?	He let him kiss you.  You said you did.	Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	Me, too, bored stiff.	Do you want some brandy?	I think I'll have a little.	Amanda, really.	Nothing.  Are you going out somewhere, darling?	Um- Well, that reply has just broken my heart.	It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	Nonsense, they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!	They snap.	So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?	I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.	I am not the slightest bit drunk.	I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.	Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?	You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.	You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.	You better turn that off, I think.	Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.	Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	I do I shall do no such thing.	Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.	Turn it off!	Very amusing indeed.	Ja! Very funny.	You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.	Oh, you're not going like this.	[GARBAGE] No, you're not.	oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.	You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.

A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.	Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?	You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.	You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.	You better turn that off, I think.	Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.	Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.	This is no time of the year for Tunis.	I do I shall do no such thing.	Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.	Turn it off!	Very amusing indeed.	Ja! Very funny.	You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.	Oh, you're not going like this.	[GARBAGE] No, you're not.	oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.	You're a wicked little vampire.  And I pray to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live.

Ses05F_script03_1	Good God.	I wonder.	Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.	With the most perfect poise.	What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.	Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].	Well, what if-what happens when our love-	Who knows?	No, that fire will fade along with our passion.	It all depends on how well we played.	Yes, yes, with all his might.	No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.	no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.

Darling, come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.	Horrible thing, I hate it.	How long did that row last?	The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	Oh, that was quite a rouser, wasn't it?	Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.	[LAUGHTER] I shall never forget his face.	Oh, we were very much younger then.	Oh, As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.
Ses05F_script03_1	Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	Behave exquisitely.	Yes, I shall probably do a Court Curtsey.	The whole business is really rather ridiculous.	Meaning exactly that.	Who's they?

Ses05F_script01_3	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?	What?	Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.	How did you know?	Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!	I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.	Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.	Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	Yeah.  I lost them.	just about all.	Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-	for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.	I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.	And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-	but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?	And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.	And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.	It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.	And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and	It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	I I want you now, Annie.	Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!
Ses05F_script01_3	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?	No, it's good.	It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.	No.  But I'm not going to stay.	Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.	Well, from her point of view why else would I come?	I guess this is why I came.	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!	Not like that, you're not.	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?	It wouldn't work like this.	yeah sure.	how many?	Oh gee.	Do you still feel like that?	Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	What would I do with a fortune?

And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	I I want you now, Annie.	Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!
Ses05F_script01_3	I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?	No.  But I'm not going to stay.	What?	Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.	How did you know?	Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!	I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.	Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.	Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	Yeah.  I lost them.	just about all.	Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-	for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.	I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.	And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-	but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?	And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.	And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.	It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.	And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and	It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.

It wouldn't work like this.	yeah sure.	how many?	Oh gee.	Do you still feel like that?	Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.

Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	What would I do with a fortune?
Ses05F_script01_3	I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?	What?	Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.	How did you know?	Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!	I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.	Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.	Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	It wouldn't work like this.	It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	Yeah.  I lost them.	just about all.	Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-	for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.	I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.	And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-	but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?	And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.	And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.	It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.	And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and	It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	I I want you now, Annie.	Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!
Ses05F_script01_3	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	No, it's good.	It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.	No.  But I'm not going to stay.	Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.	Well, from her point of view why else would I come?	I guess this is why I came.	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!	Not like that, you're not.	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?	It wouldn't work like this.	It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	yeah sure.	how many?	Oh gee.	Do you still feel like that?	Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?

And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.	And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.	It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.	And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and	It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	Do you still feel like that?	I I want you now, Annie.	Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!
Ses05F_script01_3	You're the only one I know who loves his parents.	No, it's good.	It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.	No.  But I'm not going to stay.	Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.	Well, from her point of view why else would I come?	I guess this is why I came.	I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!	Not like that, you're not.	Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  Chris, what's the matter?	It wouldn't work like this.	yeah sure.	how many?	Oh gee.	Do you still feel like that?	I I want you now, Annie.	Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	What would I do with a fortune?
Ses05F_script01_3	I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?	What?	Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.	How did you know?	Anne, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!	I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.	Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.	Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	Yeah.  I lost them.	just about all.	Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-	for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.	I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.	And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.

Ses05M_impro04	Uh, God.  I don't know what to do anymore.  Like I said --	Really? It's been that long?	Wow.	What have you been trying?	Right.	Well, I mean, right now I'm just doing a little bit of everything.  And I don't- I don't think that I'm in like a profession, like career oriented place.	No.  I'm just working in restaurants and stuff. But, I'm also trying to audition and what not.  So, it's --	Really?	L.A. is really hard.  I mean, have you tried like just going into a bar a couple of times to make friends with people who work there? and	I was just going to say that's your issue. Maybe you are going in too much. No, I mean, just	are you going into the bars every night?	Well, I don't really know.  I don't I don't know you in like a job situation, so.	Wow.  I don't -- I mean, do you- do you have an attitude problem when you're on the job?	Maybe [garbage].	Right.  Maybe you have, like, you know a little bit of an abrasive vibe or something.	I don't know.  I'm I'm just trying --	Are you getting defensive?	Yeah.  That might be something you want to look at.  I mean --	Okay.	I understand.	Yeah, it's stressful.  I recognize that.	ah.	Not- Not selling pot, right?	Okay so.	Fair enough.	Sorry.  So, let's see.  What else?  What's available? What? Um.  Hmm.	Well, not off the top of head.  It will just take you know take a minute.

What is it, three years now; right? That I haven't been able to have a job.	Really? It's been that long?	Something like that.  I can't even remember anymore. I don't know what to do anymore.  I just get out there everyday -- well, not everyday, almost everyday.	And try to do something. I mean-	Well, everything.  I'll do temping, you know, office work.  You know, whatever to pay the bills.  You know, I'll do anything.	But, I mean, I don't want to keep those jobs.  I don't want those jobs.It's not what I want to do.	But, I don't know.

But no one wants to hire me.	but Maybe they don't want to hire me because they know me. I don't know, what's wrong with me, Is there something wrong with me?	I mean, You can tell me what.  Why is no one hiring me?  Is it me?  Be honest.  You can tell me. you know I can take it.  I can take it, you just tell me. Why?	Yeah, but I'm -- okay, well how about personality wise?  I mean, people who know me won't hire me.  Why?	An abrasive vibe?	Let me know that's -- that's fine.  You think I have an abrasive vibe, whatever.  You're entitled to your opinion, of course.  Maybe that's why I don't have a job.	I'm not like this all the time.  I mean, I don't -- I'm just frustrated right now, all right.  I just want to do --	I want to make some money.  I need to make some money.  I've got to pay some bills, I owe people money.  I owe lots of people money.  I need to make some money.	Do you have any idea how I can make money?  I mean, what can I do to make some quick money, something?  Anything, that's relatively within the you know law.	Right, probably not selling pot. I don't want to go to jail.	Because that would just really be a topper for me.	Thank you.  Ha ha.	See what I mean?  You can't even think of anything.	I can juggle.	I've tried.	Yes!  Nobody wants a juggler.

And I don't- I don't think that I'm in like a profession, like career oriented place.	No.  I'm just working in restaurants and stuff. But, I'm also trying to audition and what not.  So, it's --	Really?	L.A. is really hard.  I mean, have you tried like just going into a bar a couple of times to make friends with people who work there? and	I was just going to say that's your issue. Maybe you are going in too much. No, I mean, just	are you going into the bars every night?	Well, I don't really know.  I don't I don't know you in like a job situation, so.	Yeah, but I'm -- okay, well how about personality wise?  I mean, people who know me won't hire me.  Why?	Wow.  I don't -- I mean, do you- do you have an attitude problem when you're on the job?	Maybe [garbage].	Right.  Maybe you have, like, you know a little bit of an abrasive vibe or something.	I don't know.  I'm I'm just trying --	Are you getting defensive?	Yeah.  That might be something you want to look at.  I mean --	Okay.	I understand.	Yeah, it's stressful.  I recognize that.	ah.	Not- Not selling pot, right?	Okay so.	Fair enough.	Sorry.  So, let's see.  What else?  What's available? What? Um.  Hmm.

Yeah, I mean, you're you're- when you're happy you're a pretty personable guy.  And I don't --I don't	I can't see where the issue would be. so

Ses05M_impro05	Hi. Um-  My luggage didn't come out of the conveyor thingy.	So, um, what do I do?	Uh- Like, an hour and a half ago.  I talked to somebody who was standing out there and they said wait.  Sometimes like random butt- pieces come out late.	And so I waited there, but nothing came.	I was coming from um the Midwest, like Iowa.	Yeah, I know I was in the country.  I mean, it's not that complicated.	Well, I would hope so.	People lose --	You know, this is actually, I mean it's -- it's a really important piece of luggage.	I mean, it's not big or anything like that.  I mean, it's not worth a lot of money or anything.	Well, no one even told me about that.  Like, why would I think to buy insurance?  I was- It's like a three hour flight.	How can you lose my luggage like from like, in --	I should hope so.  You know, I need that today.	Let me explain to you what the problem is.  My grandfather's remains are in that bag.  And I have to, like, distribute them today.  We're suppose to, you know, throw them out to the sea today.	Yeah.  I mean, if you have a suggestion, like, it would be great to help me out here.	Well, I don't care if it's legal.  It's happened.  It's already done.	Well, could you tell me if it's been confiscated then.	I mean, some information here would be great.  Some help.  Can you, like, type something in and find out?	That would be great.  Thank you very much.	[LAUGHTER] Okay.  Hold on.	Thank you

It's not your flashlight.	I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?	yes.	It's after eleven, let's go home.	There is no point in coming out here.	So let's go.	Not particularly.	I just don't.	Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.	I am just not.	Yes.	Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.	We didn't see them the first time either.
Ses05F_script02_1	actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?	Fine.	What flashlight?	It's not your flashlight.	I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?	yes.	It's after eleven, let's go home.

Couldn't be better--	actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?	Fine.	Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?	Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.	The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?	Whose is it?	Well, Sure.	No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it?	Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?	I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.	[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around	you want my jacket?	Right.	Why not?	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.	This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah	Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.	There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.	We weren't in a good spot.	Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?	Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.	Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.	It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.	They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.	Well, So what do you think?
Ses05F_script02_1	Fine.	Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?

Couldn't be better--	actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?	Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?	Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.	The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?	Whose is it?	Well, Sure.	No, Of course, you are right.  Our flashlight.  Me flashlight is you flashlight naturally.  How can we not think to bring it?	Are you cold?  You want my jacket?

Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.

And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.	It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.	They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.

We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?	I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.	[LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around	you want my jacket?	Right.	Why not?	Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.	Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.	This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah	What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.	Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.	There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.	We weren't in a good spot.	Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?	Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.	Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.	It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.	They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.	Well, So what do you think?
Ses05F_script02_1	Fine.	What flashlight?	It's not your flashlight.	I mean you keep saying ,my flashlight, as if it's somehow just yours.  How's that suppose to make me feel?	yes.	It's after eleven, let's go home.	There is no point in coming out here.	So let's go.	Not particularly.	I just don't.	Pass up what?  Its little fish, one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about, its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.	Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.	I am just not.	Yes.	Last year you also remember, our shoes got wet and I got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight.  You had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.	We didn't see them the first time either.

Ses05F_script02_1	What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--	actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?	Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?	Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.	The flashlight, the silver one, there's only one, isn't there?	Whose is it?
